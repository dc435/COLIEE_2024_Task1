"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [47] While the applicant has been undoubtedly prejudiced in having to undergo further proceedings and to incur additional costs in the determination of his application for permanent residence, the threshold for establishing abuse of process because of administrative delay is very high; as discussed <REFERENCE> at para 115: <TARGETCASE> Where inordinate delay has directly caused significant psychological harm to a person, or attached a stigma to a person's reputation, such that the human rights system would be brought into disrepute, such prejudice may be sufficient to constitute an abuse of process. The doctrine of abuse of process is not limited to acts giving rise to an unfair hearing; there may be cases of abuse of process for other than evidentiary reasons brought about by delay. It must however be emphasized that few lengthy delays will meet this threshold. I caution that in cases where there is no prejudice to hearing fairness, the delay must be clearly unacceptable and have directly caused a significant prejudice to amount to an abuse of process. It must be a delay that would, in the circumstances of the case, bring the human rights system into disrepute. ... <REFERENCE> ","Inordinate delay that directly causes significant psychological harm or attaches a stigma to a person's reputation, bringing the human rights system into disrepute, may constitute an abuse of process, even if there is no prejudice to hearing fairness, but the delay must be clearly unacceptable and have directly caused significant prejudice."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [9] In rebuttal, counsel for Mr. Odynsky submitted that the issue being addressed on the assessment was costs, not the standing of the Applicant. Concerning the issue of public interest, counsel referred to <TARGETCASE> which held: I think that the application of Rule 400(3) factors against the interest of successful litigants would require carefully considered discretion. Rule 409, being permissive, does not bind an assessment officer to exercise discretion exactly as the Court has done and does not automatically require that a public interest factor override all other factors so as to achieve minimum or maximum allowances. In Early Recovered Resources Inc., supra, I tempered the weight given to public interest because it was regional in nature. I doubt that, in these circumstances, I can ignore the Appellants' role in creating scrutiny of the process, but it is also uncontroverted that the Respondent had important responsibilities, including respect for the Appellants' right to proceed. The Respondent, having received the ordinary scale of party and party costs, is not bound by a public interest factor to permit the Appellants to escape completely the consequences of that costs award, ie. by minimum allowances when higher allowances might otherwise be warranted .... Counsel further contended that any issue of public interest was between the Applicant and the Attorney General of Canada. Counsel argued that Mr. Odynsky had been dragged into the application as the dispute between the Applicant and the Attorney General of Canada was his citizenship. ",Rule 409 does not bind an assessment officer to exercise discretion exactly as the Court has done and does not automatically require that a public interest factor override all other factors so as to achieve minimum or maximum allowances.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [44] The respondent notes that H&C decisions are highly discretionary and exceptional and are not designed to eliminate all hardship, but to provide relief from unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship. <TARGETCASE> ","H&C decisions are highly discretionary and exceptional, designed to provide relief from unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship, not to eliminate all hardship."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [12] State protection is reviewable on a standard of reasonableness ( <REFERENCE> ). As such, the examination goes to ""the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process"" and also to whether the decision as a whole ""falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law"" ( <TARGETCASE> ). ","State protection is reviewable on a standard of reasonableness, examining the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process, and whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes defensible in respect of the facts and law."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [9] The Officer, in substance, incorrectly elevated the test for the best interests of the child. Although the Officer did not use the specific language of ""unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship"" in his best interests analysis, it is clear from reading the decision as a whole that the Officer was on a search for undeserved or disproportionate hardship. Further, the Officer did not turn his mind to identifying the best interests of the child. It is well-established that an officer must be ""alert, alive and sensitive"" to the interests of the child: Baker at para 75. In order for an officer to be properly ""alert, alive and sensitive"" to a child's best interests, the officer should have regard to the child's circumstances, from the child's perspective. <TARGETCASE> ","An officer must be 'alert, alive and sensitive' to the interests of the child, and should consider the child's circumstances from the child's perspective."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [22] The applicant submits that the officer failed to take into account evidence relevant to the consideration of personal suitability in making her decision, in particular the applicant's employer's assessment and his volunteer activities. The visa officer has discretion in weighing evidence related to personal suitability. I agree with the position taken by my colleague Madame Justice Simpson in <REFERENCE> the Officer exercised her discretion inappropriately by overlooking relevant factors or by placing undue emphasis on particular factors or in some way acting unfairly, I am not in a position to second-guess her exercise of discretion. <REFERENCE> In that case, the applicant argued that the officer had overlooked supportive character references in arriving at her determination of personal suitability. Simpson, J., responded to this submission as follows: <TARGETCASE> ""I have concluded that there is no reason to suppose that the Officer overlooked the references. I think that the Officer concluded that the fact that the applicant was a hard worker was not overcome by the fact that he did not advance in his chosen field, either by study or by employment. It was open to the Officer to find that these were the most significant factors in her assessment of the applicant's personal suitability. <REFERENCE> ","The Officer can conclude that the fact that the applicant was a hard worker was not overcome by the fact that he did not advance in his chosen field, either by study or by employment, and these can be the most significant factors in her assessment of the applicant's personal suitability."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [24] On this point, the Respondent argues that the Officer's conclusion that there was insufficient evidence cannot be read in isolation and must be considered in the context of the findings and summary of evidence prior to such conclusion. The Respondent states that this Court should not interfere with the Officer's decision unless it is outside the range of acceptable outcomes (citing TARGETCASE). ",The Court should not interfere with the Officer's decision unless it is outside the range of acceptable outcomes.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [49] If there is such a duty to preserve evidence, it only concerns documentary evidence, not testimonies. In all the leading cases on the issue of preservation and spoliation of evidence, the central question was the destruction of documents by one party: see, for ex., TARGETCASE. It could even be argued that it would have been wrong for the NRC to talk to its employees, as it could have been perceived to taint the process. It is much preferable to leave the investigation to the Commission, precisely to avoid this pitfall. E. Did the Tribunal Err in Law by Placing No Weight on the Significance of Documentary Exhibits in the Present Case? ","The duty to preserve evidence only concerns documentary evidence, not testimonies."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [29] I must recall that while the construction of a patent is for the court, the specification (including both disclosure and claims) is directed to a person skilled in the art at the date of the patent and the knowledge such a person is expected to possess is to be taken into consideration (see <REFERENCE> , at 101 and 104, and Fox, Canadian Patent Law (4th) p. 206). The claims are read as part of the entire patent and not as a separate document. <TARGETCASE> C.P.R.(2d) 1, the Federal Court of Appeal recognized that resort may be had to the disclosure to assist in interpreting the claims. Indeed, after having reviewed the relevant authorities and the principles applicable in the construction of patents, Mr. Justice Urie, at page 11, summarized those principles as follows: ""In summary, the principles which I derive from the above-mentioned authorities as well as from others referred to in argument, to which further reference need not be made here, are that in construing the claims in a patent recourse to the remainder of the specification is (a) permissible only to assist in understanding terms used in the claims; (b) unnecessary where the words of the claim are plain and unambiguous; and (c) improper to vary the scope or ambit of the claims. There may well be other principles applicable in the construction of claims but the foregoing are those to be borne in mind in dealing with the attacks on the trial judgment in this appeal."" ","In construing the claims in a patent, recourse to the remainder of the specification is permissible only to assist in understanding terms used in the claims, unnecessary where the words of the claim are plain and unambiguous, and improper to vary the scope or ambit of the claims."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [147] Prothonotary Tabib appears to have been concerned not to impose obligations regarding responses to undertakings that were too disconnected from the principles that guide cross-examination on an affidavit to begin with. This seems a legitimate concern to me: if a party cannot compel an affiant to inform herself or disclose documents in response to questions asked at the cross-examination itself, does an undertaking (or an implied undertaking through a response) suddenly transform the process into full-blown discovery? At the same time, the jurisprudence outlined above is clear that parties must honour their undertakings to respond to questions or disclose documents. The <TARGETCASE> case referred to (also decided by Prothonotary Tabib) provides the following analysis regarding how these competing considerations are to be balanced: ","Parties must honour their undertakings to respond to questions or disclose documents, but these obligations should not transform the process into full-blown discovery."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [246] This is a different situation than that which existed in relation to the '453 patent. In that case, memantine was already being used for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, although no one understood its mechanism of action or why it worked. Based upon the reasoning in <TARGETCASE> , I found that the discovery of memantine's mechanism of action was not novel, and that the '453 patent was anticipated by prior art teaching the use of memantine for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. ","The discovery of a drug's mechanism of action is not novel if the drug is already being used for the treatment of a disease, even if its mechanism of action was previously unknown."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [10] When reviewing a credibility finding, it must be kept in mind that an administrative tribunal is in an advantageous position for assessing the credibility of witnesses, accordingly, the Court must show deference when reviewing findings of this kind ( <REFERENCE> (TD) at paras 7 to 9). The Court will only intervene in a credibility finding if the decision-maker based its decision on ""an erroneous finding of fact made in a perverse or capricious manner or if it made its decision without regard to the material before it"" ( <TARGETCASE> , above). Analysis ",The Court will only intervene in a credibility finding if the decision-maker based its decision on an erroneous finding of fact made in a perverse or capricious manner or if it made its decision without regard to the material before it.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: ""I am accordingly of the opinion that it was open to Mr. Justice Jackett in the circumstances of this case to substitute his conclusion for that of the Registrar and I do not think that he was precluded from doing so by the decision of this court in <REFERENCE> before the Registrar, the courts have accorded reduced deference to the decision of the Registrar, and have characterized the appeal proceeding as a trial de novo. In the case at bar, the parties are relying on additional evidence that was not before the Registrar. The role of this court, in such circumstances, was described by Justice Rouleau of the Federal Court, Trial Division, in <REFERENCE> C.P.R.(3d) 205 (T.D.), at pp. 208-209 (C.P.R.): ""At the outset I should note that this court has consistently said that a decision of the Registrar as to whether two marks are confusing is to be given great weight and not to be lightly set aside: <REFERENCE> . However, where the court has the benefit of considering evidence not before the Registrar, the discretion of the court will be totally unfettered by the previous decision of the Registrar and, in essence, the appeal functions as a trial de novo: <TARGETCASE> ; 32 F.T.R. 274; 19 A.C.W.S.(3d) 911 (T.D.).","Where the court has the benefit of considering evidence not before the Registrar, the discretion of the court will be totally unfettered by the previous decision of the Registrar and, in essence, the appeal functions as a trial de novo."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [48] Duplicitous proceedings, which would be the result of a stay in the present matter, are always strong grounds for refusing a stay: see for example <TARGETCASE> a motion for a stay in part because of duplicity of litigation and thus the substantial risk of conflicting judgments leading to prejudice. In the latter, The Pine Hill , Mr. Justice McNair noted that duplicate proceedings might not only result in inconsistent findings of fact by two different tribunals, but also would be a waste of time and money (page 151). These concerns are very real when applied to the present situation, for I have found that Tokyo Marine Co. Ltd. is not entitled to a stay in order to arbitrate in London, but must litigate in Canada: it is clearly much more appropriate to deny a stay to Fontaine Navigation S.A. than to allow it to run a duplicate set of proceedings in Japan. <REFERENCE> ","Duplicitous proceedings are strong grounds for refusing a stay due to the risk of conflicting judgments, inconsistent findings of fact by different tribunals, and waste of time and money."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [39] <TARGETCASE> Justice Gagné distinguished the facts of that case from those established in <REFERENCE> . The applicant in <REFERENCE> had approached a crew member of the MV Sun Sea and asked to cook for the crew in exchange for extra food. He was also assigned a daily duty of watch keeping. This was in contrast to the facts in <REFERENCE> where the panel had found that the applicant had boarded the ship knowing that he would be a crew member. Similarly, in the present matter the male applicant had not been a crew member at the outset of the voyage.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [51] The Respondent points out that the Officer's reasons refer to the <TARGETCASE> case as having informed her analysis, in particular the included quote from <REFERENCE> (FCTD), which stated: I return to my observation that the evidence suggests that the applicants would be a welcome addition to the Canadian community. Unfortunately, that is not the test. To make it the test is to make the H & C process an ex post facto screening device which supplants the screening process contained in the Immigration Act and Regulations . This would encourage gambling on refugee claims in the belief that if someone can stay in Canada long enough to demonstrate that they are the kind of persons Canada wants, they would be allowed to stay. The H & C process is not designed to eliminate hardship; it is designed to provide relief from unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship. There is no doubt that the refusal of an applicants' H & C application will cause hardship but, given the circumstances of the applicants' presence in Canada and the state of the record, it is not unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship. . . .

In authorizing such supervision by the Superintendent, Parliament's primary aim is to protect third parties, whether they be debtors or creditors. The nature of the role played by trustees makes the existence of such rules necessary. Trustees act as fiduciaries and as such, as we have seen, they are responsible for administering property owned by others.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [85] The Board proceeded to consider the jurisprudence, including the decisions of Justice Mosley in <TARGETCASE> , supra, and Justice Harrington in <REFERENCE> , supra. At paragraph 93 of its reasons, the Board concluded that if a dosage is claimed as part of the patent monopoly, it must not be in the form of a range. It wrote: 93 From this limited jurisprudence we may take that, if a dosage is claimed as part of the patent monopoly it must not be in the form of a range, such that in order to determine the appropriate dosage for a particular patient, specific knowledge of that patient is required, and judgement is required based on that knowledge, matters which fall within the skills of the physician, and are therefore unpatentable. As Mr. Justice Harrington put it, the dosage must be in ""vendible product"" form, and not in the form of a guideline to physicians. This would seem to accord with the previous quote from Mr. Justice Binnie in <REFERENCE> . If what is claimed can no longer be considered a ""commercial offering"", then it may fall within the exclusion. This is of course, not to say that a claim, in order to be patentable, must be directed to a ""vendible product"" or a ""commercial offering"".

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [12] Both parties referred me to the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in <TARGETCASE> N.B.R.(2d) 207; 674 A.P.R. 207, as instructive on the question of the meaning of reasonableness simpliciter. Justice Iacobucci, writing in a unanimous decision of the Court in that case, considered what the reasonableness standard requires of a reviewing court. Helpfully, he pointed out a number of characteristics of this standard and how the Court should conduct its ""somewhat probing analysis"". For purposes of this application and the issues raised by the Applicant, I view the following statement of Justice Iacobucci to be the most instructive: ""A decision will be unreasonable only if there is no line of analysis within the given reasons that could reasonably lead the tribunal from the evidence before it to the conclusion at which it arrived."" (para. 55) ",A decision will be unreasonable only if there is no line of analysis within the given reasons that could reasonably lead the tribunal from the evidence before it to the conclusion at which it arrived.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [24] Furthermore, the Respondent argues, the 20 October 2010 paper screening was not a selection decision. It was tentative, not conclusive. It outlined the points that the Applicant might receive based on the selection criteria, pending the receipt of further information. For example, three points were preliminarily allocated for adaptability, but this was subject to confirmation of the Applicant's wife's educational credentials. <TARGETCASE> , above, at para 28 confirmed that a paper screening is not a selection decision as envisioned in subsection 87.4(1). OB 442 also confirms that a preliminary review of the file does not qualify as a selection decision pursuant to paragraph 87.4(1), and that no decision could have been made when further information had been requested but not assessed. ","A paper screening is not a selection decision as envisioned in subsection 87.4(1), and a preliminary review of the file does not qualify as a selection decision pursuant to paragraph 87.4(1)."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [32] As noted by the adjudicator, in <REFERENCE> , at paras 253-256, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice awarded aggravated damages due to loss suffered from a damaged reputation: <REFERENCE> 253 Wallace held that where ""bad faith"" or unfair conduct of the employer causes intangible losses such as humiliation, embarrassment, damage to self-esteem, these losses should be compensated for even if there is no consequent tangible loss. <TARGETCASE> 254 The intangible damage flowing from wrongful actions of the employer in the case before me resulted in humiliation, embarrassment, loss of self-esteem and loss of enjoyment of social activities. Unlike the routine case, these losses were not temporary. These losses have continued for the better part of 4 years up to the present. I find that the losses will be diminished by this judgment but that there will be a lingering loss. As the plaintiff has already experienced, ""clouds"" on one's character are difficult to eradicate. <REFERENCE> 255 I assess these losses at $50,000. <REFERENCE> ","Bad faith"" or unfair conduct of the employer causing intangible losses such as humiliation, embarrassment, damage to self-esteem should be compensated for, even if there is no consequent tangible loss."

question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [4] The existence of contradictions or inconsistencies between port of entry notes and an applicant's oral testimony is an accepted basis for an adverse credibility finding where the port of entry notes are extensive and contain major differences from an applicant's later evidence: <TARGETCASE> (QL) at para. 33 (F.C.A.).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [98] As the Respondent points out, the Federal Court of Appeal in Canada (Minister of Citizenship and <TARGETCASE> held that where there is a general finding that the claimant lacks credibility, that determination is sufficient to dispose of the claim unless there is independent and credible documentary evidence in the record capable of supporting a positive disposition of the claim. I see no serious issue raised by the Applicants' assertion that the Board ought to have included a gender-based analysis simply because country documentation for Haiti discusses the prevalence of gender-related violence. Given Sellen , and the Federal Court of Appeal in <REFERENCE> which affirmed that mere reference to general documentary evidence about human rights in a country is insufficient for a positive disposition of the claim, the second question would not be dispositive of the appeal. ","Where there is a general finding that the claimant lacks credibility, that determination is sufficient to dispose of the claim unless there is independent and credible documentary evidence in the record capable of supporting a positive disposition of the claim."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [9] By analogy with that rule and acting under rule 5, the so-called ""gap rule"", the court on appropriate occasions has ordered parties added as respondents in proceedings for judicial review, in particular before amendment of the Rules in 1992 which provided, for the first time, rules particularly directed to the process for judicial review under s. 18.1 of the Federal Court Act , R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7 as amended. See, e.g. <TARGETCASE> C.P.R.(3d) 286 (T.D.) where Mr. Justice Dubé found the applicant to be added as a respondent, John Labatt Limited , had a direct interest in proceedings to set aside the Registrar's decision made in opposition proceedings in which the Molson and Labatt companies had been active opponents.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [11] As to the issue of using affidavits, I have nothing to add to the Prothonotary's decision; it allows for the filing of an affidavit with an exhibit.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [62] Before closing, I should note that my decision should not be interpreted to mean that the HPA could never be considered to be a ""federal board, commission or other tribunal"" as contemplated by the Federal Courts Act . It is clear that the question of whether an institution is acting as a ""federal board, commission or other tribunal"" in a given set of circumstances is one that has to be resolved on a case-by-case basis, having regard to both the status of the organization in question and the nature of the power being exercised in the case itself. <REFERENCE> Conclusion <TARGETCASE> ","The question of whether an institution is acting as a 'federal board, commission or other tribunal' is to be resolved on a case-by-case basis, considering both the status of the organization and the nature of the power being exercised in the case."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [35] I agree with the Applicant that it the Officer's risk of the Applicant remaining in Canada vs. his purported need to stay in the country analysis was not detailed in the reasons so as to list all possible considerations laid out in the criminal inadmissibility section of the Manual. Surely, this is perplexing for the Applicant. However, it has been repeatedly held that guidelines such as the Manual are not law, are not binding on the Minister or his agents, and do not create any legal entitlement. While they can be of assistance to the Court, they cannot fetter the discretion of an officer ( <TARGETCASE> ). <REFERENCE> ","Guidelines such as the Manual are not law, are not binding on the Minister or his agents, and do not create any legal entitlement, and they cannot fetter the discretion of an officer."

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [18] As concerns the third alleged error regarding section 97 of IRPA, given the Board's reasoning in the decision, it is less certain that the applicable standard of review is that of reasonableness. While it is well-settled that the determination of whether an applicant faces a generalized risk is typically one of mixed fact and law and, thus, reviewable on a reasonableness standard (see e.g. <TARGETCASE> ",The determination of whether an applicant faces a generalized risk is typically one of mixed fact and law and is reviewable on a reasonableness standard.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [11] The parties agree that the overall standard of review to be applied in an appeal from a citizenship decision is reasonableness. The weight of Federal Court jurisprudence, both prior to and subsequent to the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in <TARGETCASE> supports that conclusion. See for example: <REFERENCE> at para. 6; Canada (Minister of Citizenship and <REFERENCE> at paras. 13-16. <REFERENCE> ",The overall standard of review to be applied in an appeal from a citizenship decision is reasonableness.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [27] The Supreme Court of Canada in <TARGETCASE> above, at paragraph 47, took the occasion to enunciate the elements of a decision on the standard of reasonableness which is salient to the case at hand: ""[a] court conducting a review for reasonableness inquires into the qualities that make a decision reasonable, referring both to the process of articulating the reasons and to outcomes. In judicial review, reasonableness is concerned mostly with the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process. But it is also concerned with whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law."" ","A court conducting a review for reasonableness inquires into the qualities that make a decision reasonable, referring both to the process of articulating the reasons and to outcomes, and is concerned with the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process, and whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law."

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [56] In my opinion, inferring a particularized hardship from the general country conditions is an indirect means to apply them to the entire population, without having to demonstrate that the conditions personally and directly affect the claimant. It also results in a situation where ""every H&C application made by a national of a country with problems would have to be assessed positively"" ( <REFERENCE> at para 1). Accordingly, I also conclude that inferring particularized personal hardship from generalized country conditions would be inconsistent with the principles enunciated in <TARGETCASE> in adopting the reasoning in <REFERENCE> .

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [36] The Respondent argues that the Board's finding that the Applicant had failed to establish his identity was both reasonable and determinative.

Section 106 of the Act and Rule 7 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules , SOR/2012-256, requires applicants to put forward acceptable documents to establish their identity.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [29] Furthermore, in the circumstances of this case a lack of documentary evidence cannot be used to impugn the applicants' credibility. The Board refers to a lack of ""necessary documentary evidence"" without identifying what evidence it expected the applicants to present. Given that the threat was by telephone one must question what documentary evidence could be adduced. The only document that comes to my mind is a police report. However, given that the applicants explained that they never contacted the authorities, the absence of a police report cannot be used to impugn their credibility. In fact, had there been a police report it would have been evidence that their testimony, at least in this respect, was false. Given the facts before the Court, the absence of a police report may be an issue when considering state protection, but not when considering the applicants' credibility. <TARGETCASE> 3.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [28] In my view, the plaintiff in the instant case is not in the repair business and does not provide repair services. The plaintiff does not repair , but replaces covers. In a 1991 decision of the Supreme Court of Newfoundland, Corner Brook Pulp and <TARGETCASE> (Nfld. T.D.) Soper, J., had to deal with ""roll recovering"" in a pulp and paper mill with reference to the provincial Retail Sales Tax Act .

""One stage of the paper making process uses large, steel roll [sic] which are covered with material. That material is subject to and may be replaced. In the replacement process the material removed [sic], the roll is cleaned and made ready to be covered again.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [30] The Officer here did not consider whether it might be in the children's best interests to stay in Canada with their parents and maintain the status quo. As Mr. Justice Donald Rennie noted in REFERENCE: ""In order for an officer to be properly 'alert, alive and sensitive' to a child's best interests, the officer should have regard to the child's circumstances, from the child's perspective."" This perspective was unreasonably ignored by the Officer in this case.

At the time of the application, two of the four children were still under the age of 18, and their interests needed to be reasonably assessed. In addition, there were dozens of letters from the children's teachers which attested to their academic achievements, communication skills, etc. It is apparent from the one paragraph of the Officer's reasons quoted above that she did not properly identify and define the BIOC and examine them ""with a great deal of attention"" ( REFERENCE) or ""with care"" ( TARGETCASE).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [6] The meaning of the provision was recently considered by Justice Harrington in <REFERENCE> . In that case, the Applicant fathered a child out of wedlock, whom he later sought to sponsor to come to Canada. It is important to note that the Applicant in that case was not found to be credible.

Undoubtedly, the existence of a child is a material fact. <REFERENCE> 17 I do not find this comparison helpful. Section 127 is in the ""General Offences"" section of IRPA. A misrepresentation could lead to imprisonment for a term of up to five years.

Sun Sea"" (AI report) expressly identified a risk to all those on board the M.V. Sun Sea based on the Sri Lankan government's perception that they are LTTE supporters. AI is a credible and reliable source ( <TARGETCASE> [ Sittampalam ]). As the Board failed to consider the AI and the Freedom from Torture reports, it committed a serious and reviewable error ( <REFERENCE> ). Further, the report to which the Board did refer, being the Response to Information Request, LKA103815.E ""Sri Lanka: Information on the Treatment of Tamil returnees to Sri Lanka, including failed refugee applicants; repercussions, upon return, for not having government authorization to leave the country, such as a passport"" contained conflicting statements which were ignored by the Board.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [14] Under ""Analysis"" the Report observed that decisions not to deal with a complaint at the section 41 stage of the Commission's process are subject to a higher level of judicial scrutiny (citing <REFERENCE> [ <TARGETCASE> ]), that the Commission should only decide not to deal with complaints in plain and obvious cases, and that the allegations of fact contained in a complaint must be taken as true (citing <REFERENCE> [ Keith ]). It observed that the requirement of ""reasonable grounds"" presents a low threshold, but nonetheless ""obliges a complainant to provide some basis for the allegations"" (citing <REFERENCE> [ <REFERENCE> ]). The Report goes on to provide the following analysis leading up to its conclusion: 18. More than speculation is needed to file a complaint. ""Reasonable grounds"" require more than just a statement or bald assertion that the conduct is discriminatory.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [14] In Baker, the Supreme Court determined that the appropriate standard of review for decisions based on H & C grounds was that of reasonableness simpliciter. Although that decision related to an application for landing from within Canada, this standard is equally applicable to H & C applications from outside <TARGETCASE> at paragraph 56, the Supreme Court explained that “[a] n unreasonable decision is one that, in the main, is not supported by any reasons that can stand up to a somewhat probing examination.” However, where issues of procedural fairness, including the inadequacy of the reasons given by the decision-maker, are called into question, the pragmatic and functional approach need not be applied ( <REFERENCE> ).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [59] It would be, however, artificial to consider the Admissibility Division in isolation from the rest of the IRPA , as it relates to the Applicant. As was recognized by my colleagues in <TARGETCASE> and <REFERENCE> , the Applicant had the right to make an application to the Minister for an exemption on humanitarian and compassionate (""H & C"") grounds (s. 25). He could have availed himself of a pre-removal risk assessment (s. 112). Under both of these processes, the Applicant would been permitted to make submissions that would have been taken into account by the decision makers. None of the Officer's Report, the s. 44(2) Referral or the removal order is the end of all possibilities for the Applicant to remain in Canada.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [52] Perhaps more to the point is Sir Eric Sachs' separate set of reasons in <REFERENCE> confidential relationships, which may arise in unusual and widely differing sets of circumstances. He had thought it neither feasible nor desirable to attempt to draw demarcation lines around that relation. He said at page 341: <REFERENCE> ""Such cases tend to arise where someone relies on the guidance or advice of another, where the other is aware of that reliance and where the person upon whom reliance is placed obtains, or may well obtain, a benefit from the transaction or has some other interest in it being concluded. <REFERENCE> . . . . . <TARGETCASE> ""Confidentiality, a relatively little used word, is being here adopted, albeit with some hesitation, to avoid the possible confusion that can arise through referring to 'confidence'.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [75] One further aspect of the issue concerning the application of the Guidelines Order is left to be explored. That is, whether that order, and necessarily, the statute under which it was adopted, the Department of Environment Act can be said to affect the prerogative power of the Governor-in-Council to adopt the Orders-in-Council here questioned. Much the same issue arose in <TARGETCASE> the Guidelines Order was a prerequisite to action by the Governor-in-Council, in that case not based on the prerogative power but upon authority delegated by Parliament. For the majority of the Court of Appeal Mr. Justice MacGuigan found that the Guidelines Order did not apply to decisions of the Governor-in-Council made pursuant to s. 64 of the National Transportation Act since the Governor-in-Council could not have been intended to be included as a ""department, board or agency of the Government of Canada"" to which the Guidelines Order was expressly made applicable in terms consistent with the authorizing statutory provision, s. 6 of the Department of Environment Act .

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [24] Several decisions of our Court have addressed the appropriate degree of deference the RAD should show to the RPD's findings of fact. There are two main emerging schools, each of which favours an approach calling for a different degree of deference. On the one hand, there are the proponents of the palpable and overriding error standard; on the other hand, there are those who consider that the RPD need not show deference to the RPD's findings of fact. However, many of the judges who consider that the RAD need not show deference to the RPD's findings of fact nevertheless acknowledge that the RAD must exercise some deference where the credibility of the witness is crucial or determinative. Justice Gagné clearly summarizes the jurisprudence on this point in REFERENCE: 32 This Court has recently issued several decisions concerning the role of the newly created RAD (see REFERENCE; REFERENCE; TARGETCASE and REFERENCE.","Many judges believe that while the RAD need not show deference to the RPD's findings of fact, it must exercise some deference where the credibility of the witness is crucial or determinative."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [7] However, the use of the phrase ""serious efforts"" in this case is not merely an injudicious choice of language at one point in an otherwise proper analysis.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [21] The case law is not clear regarding when a visa officer's concerns must be put to the applicant where those concerns are based on the information submitted by the applicant to the visa officer. For example, in <REFERENCE> ; 2002 FCT 468 at paras. 35-37 ( Hussain ), the Court addressed whether the visa officer had breached his duty of fairness by failing to raise his alleged concerns with the applicant about the applicant's personal suitability and/or his English language fluency, and by failing to provide the applicant with an opportunity to address any such concerns. The Court found that the officer was not required to put before the applicant any tentative conclusions he might be drawing from the material. The Court noted that the visa officer was merely assessing the information provided to him by the applicant as he must do in order to reach a decision. The Court highlighted that the burden is on the applicant to prove that he has a right to come to Canada. This approach was also taken by the Court in <TARGETCASE> , at para. 35. <REFERENCE> ","A visa officer is not required to present any tentative conclusions drawn from the applicant's material, and the burden is on the applicant to prove their right to come to Canada."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [17] With respect to the proceedings in Dr. Zhou's case, the Respondent argues that a court cannot treat as evidence in the present proceedings what is asserted in another proceeding unless it be introduced into evidence by the normal means, and relies on <TARGETCASE> (QL). I agree. However, I will point out that this Court can take notice of the fact that these proceedings are ongoing, and of Justice Phelan's conclusion in <REFERENCE> , supra, that the Commission's decision to refer the matter to the CHRT was not unreasonable.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [38] Secondly, the judgment of the Court was limited to a writ of prohibition prohibiting the enforcement of a deportation order; the underlying decision was not quashed. Nor, as I read the decision and the relevant law, was Justice Mahoney suggesting that it should be quashed. As stated by Justice Mahoney, the basis for the deportation order no longer existed in fact and, by operation of the provision of the Criminal Code , the basis (that is, the conviction) never existed. Applied to the facts before me, Kalicharan seems to stand for the proposition that a deportation order or other instrument seeking to remove the Applicant from Canada could not be enforced - nothing more. A similar conclusion was reached in <TARGETCASE> (TD), where Justice Dubé held that a deportation order could not be executed after Mr. Saini received a pardon for his crimes in Pakistan. <REFERENCE> ",A deportation order cannot be enforced after the recipient of the order has received a pardon for their crimes.

He chose to follow the decisions of Justice Russell in <TARGETCASE> constitutes a ""first person"" within the meaning of the Regulations did not require a full trial, and could be dealt with on a motion for summary judgment. By contrast, Justice Heneghan dismissed Eli Lilly Canada's motion for summary judgment with respect to Apotex' claim for unjust enrichment in the context of its section 8 action and declined to answer the question of the Court's jurisdiction over a claim for unjust enrichment, holding that this more complex question was best dealt with by the trial judge.

In Lewis at para 43, Justice Scott stated: 43 <TARGETCASE> is the leading case. It states that section 108(1)(e) will only apply when the decision maker has made a determination that the person has had a valid claim for refugee protection due to persecution. The decision maker must then find that the cause of that persecution no longer exists. At this point, the decision maker can consider 108(4) and ""...whether the nature of the claimant's experiences in the former country were so appalling that he or she should not be expected to return and put himself or herself under the protection of that state"".

This test is to be distinguished from the most deferential standard of review, which requires courts to consider whether a tribunal's decision is patently unreasonable. An unreasonable decision is one that, in the main, is not supported by any reasons that can stand up to a somewhat probing examination. Accordingly, a court reviewing a conclusion on the reasonableness standard must look to see whether any reasons support it. The defect, if there is one, could presumably be in the evidentiary foundation itself or in the logical process by which conclusions are sought to be drawn from it. An example of the former kind of defect would be an assumption that had no basis in the evidence, or that was contrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence.","The third standard of review should be whether the decision of the Tribunal is unreasonable, distinguished from the most deferential standard of review, which requires courts to consider whether a tribunal's decision is patently unreasonable."

The decision-maker was the Governor in Council, which pointed to a high level of deference. However, it had little experience addressing legal issues; 3.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [21] During the hearing of this matter, counsel for the parties acknowledged the current debate in this Court over the standard by which the RAD should review the RPD's findings of fact and mixed fact and law. As noted by Mr. Justice Martineau in <REFERENCE> [ <REFERENCE> ], two approaches have been taken by this Court. One line of cases concludes that the RAD should review the RPD's findings of fact for palpable and overriding errors (see e.g.: <REFERENCE> [ <TARGETCASE> ]; and <REFERENCE> ). Another line of cases concludes that the RAD must independently come to a decision and is not limited to intervening on the standard of palpable and overriding error, although it can ""recognize and respect the conclusion of the RPD on such issues as credibility and/or where the RPD enjoys a particular advantage in reaching such a conclusion"" ( <REFERENCE> [ <REFERENCE> ]; <REFERENCE> ; and <REFERENCE> [ <REFERENCE> ]). Questions on this issue have been certified in several of these cases, so this division in the case law will soon be considered by the Federal Court of Appeal. In the meantime, a pragmatic approach as suggested in <REFERENCE> (at paras 46-52) means that the decisions of the RAD should be upheld so long as either of these two approaches is applied. ",The RAD should review the RPD's findings of fact for palpable and overriding errors or must independently come to a decision and is not limited to intervening on the standard of palpable and overriding error.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [87] By his own admission, the respondent maintains the pretence of residing in the UAE in order to compel payment from his debtors. The Citizenship Judge took note of this fact but did not stop to ask whether it showed that Mr Vijayan has not truly centralized his life in Canada. This was a reviewable error. The jurisprudence is clear that an individual does not meet the Koo standard if he splits his residence between two or more countries. Justice Snider's comments in Canada (Citizenship and <REFERENCE> re instructive: Indeed, almost every fact before the Citizenship Judge points away from a grant of Canadian citizenship. Not only had Ms. Willoughby spent 745 days out of Canada, her pattern of absences was not about to change. Ms. Willoughby maintains a dwelling in Australia that she uses during her visits with her immediate family members (her daughters and grandchildren) in Australia. Even though Ms. Willoughby has a home and husband in Canada, her extensive absences from Canada constitute ""a structural mode of living abroad rather than just a temporary situation"" ( Canada (Minister of Citizenship and <TARGETCASE> FTR 37 [emphasis omitted]). The most that can be said is that Ms. Willoughby has established two homes - one in Canada and one in Australia. As pointed out by Justice Martineau in Canada (Minister of Citizenship and <REFERENCE> ",Extensive absences from Canada constitute 'a structural mode of living abroad rather than just a temporary situation'.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [19] On the particular facts of this case, the Board's conclusion was reasonably open to it. First, the Board reasonably characterized the risk faced by the Applicant as one of extortion. The Applicant's attempt to characterize it otherwise to my mind is not persuasive because, whether the ultimate money will come from the Applicant or her brother, the fact is that she is being targeted for the purpose of extorting money. Second, the Board reasonably found that a risk of extortion by criminal gangs is one faced generally by individuals in El Salvador who are perceived to be wealthy. Finally, the Board correctly applied the jurisprudence, including <TARGETCASE> , that states that even if wealthy people face an elevated risk, that does not constitute a personalized risk under s. 97. ","Even if wealthy people face an elevated risk, that does not constitute a personalized risk under s. 97."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [9] The Appeal Board Rules do not provide for an appeal in respect of a decision to grant leave to appeal; however Justice Blanchard of this Court, in <TARGETCASE> etermined that such a decision may be judicially reviewed in this Court. ",A decision to grant leave to appeal may be judicially reviewed in this Court.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [28] While the evidence rules referred to above are not specific to the immigration context, I am satisfied that they can apply in the current case. The Court <TARGETCASE> arrived at a different conclusion by relying on jurisprudence from the refugee context where it is an important principle that there is a presumption of truth that whatever a claimant swears to is true and the truthfulness of a claimant’s allegations cannot be rebutted through negative inferences. The case at hand is not a refugee case and the Board was entitled to draw a negative inference from the fact that neither of the applicant’s parents testified for her. Clearly the applicant’s parents have knowledge of the applicant’s religion and there is no reason to believe that her parents would be unwilling to assist her. Thus, it was not patently unreasonable for the Board to draw a negative inference. ","There is a presumption of truth that whatever a claimant swears to is true and the truthfulness of a claimant’s allegations cannot be rebutted through negative inferences in the refugee context, but in non-refugee cases, the Board is entitled to draw a negative inference if a claimant's parents do not testify."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [98] Accordingly, the dictionary approach to claims construction is rejected ( REFERENCE), but the purposive claims construction would take into account the primacy of the language used. It is also clear that the construction must consider the disclosure and the claim. In TARGETCASE , supra , Dickson J. writes at pages 520-521: We must look to the whole of the disclosure and the claims to ascertain the nature of the invention and methods of its performance, ( REFERENCE), being neither benevolent nor harsh, but rather seeking a construction which is reasonable and fair to both patentee and public. There is no occasion for being too astute or technical in the matter of objections to either title or specification for, as Duff C.J.C. said, giving the judgment of the Court in REFERENCE, ""where the language of the specification, upon a reasonable view of it, can be so read as to afford the inventor protection for that which he has actually in good faith invented, the court, as a rule, will endeavour to give effect to that construction"". Sir George Jessel spoke to like effect at a much earlier date in REFERENCE. He said the patent should be approached ""with a judicial anxiety to support a really useful invention"". ","We must look to the whole of the disclosure and the claims to ascertain the nature of the invention and methods of its performance, seeking a construction which is reasonable and fair to both patentee and public."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [17] I now proceed to the second issue discussed by Justice MacKay in <TARGETCASE> . In my view, none of the matters raised by the applicant would lead me to find that the Board made an error of law, or of the appreciation of facts in its determination of whether an arguable case is raised. <REFERENCE> ","None of the matters raised by the applicant would lead me to find that the Board made an error of law, or of the appreciation of facts in its determination of whether an arguable case is raised."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [38] The other grounds the applicant relies on all concern the Tribunal's application of the concept of abuse of authority within the meaning of the PSEA and of discrimination under the CHRA.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [50] The general principle underlying the common law duty of fairness is that notice must be adequate to provide those concerned with a reasonable opportunity to investigate the matter and prepare representations. Those directly affected by a decision are entitled to notice, although the precise requirements of what constitutes proper notice will depend on all of the circumstances involved, see <TARGETCASE> . The applicants were directly affected by the Custom Council's proposed amendment and were entitled to notice of the tribal meeting held January 22.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [33] To conclude, this Court has held in previous decisions that a PRRA officer has no duty to disclose his or her decision regarding a PRRA application to the applicant where that officer also decides the humanitarian and compassionate application. More specifically, in <REFERENCE> Martineau, J., said that the PRRA officer had no duty to give the applicant an opportunity to make comments before reaching a final decision on her application ( <REFERENCE> at para. 21; <TARGETCASE> ; <REFERENCE> , supra, at para. 39; <REFERENCE> at para. 37; <REFERENCE> at para. 41).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [41] The applicable test for determining whether a reasonable apprehension of bias exists in the circumstances of a particular case was set out in Committee for Justice and <TARGETCASE> ; 9 N.R. 115. The test is: ""... what would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically - and having thought the matter through - conclude. Would he think that it is more likely than not that the Tribunal here, whether consciously or unconsciously, would not decide fairly?"" It is not necessary to find actual bias. Rather, it is the perception that a decision could be biased which renders the decision a nullity. ","The test for determining a reasonable apprehension of bias is what an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically, would conclude about the likelihood of the Tribunal not deciding fairly, and it is the perception of potential bias, not actual bias, that renders a decision null."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [38] It has also been recognized by this Court that the situation <REFERENCE> is a difficult one.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [25] Even so, I do not see evidence in the record that would have enabled the Officer to conclude that leaving the minor children in Canada was a serious possibility. While the evidence certainly indicated that the elder Aslam children, Sohail and Amna, appeared financially stable and competent, it is a much further leap to presume they were prepared to accept the obligations of rearing their younger siblings in Canada. There appears to be little to no probative evidence in the record, such as affidavits from the elder children committing themselves to such an endeavour or a transfer of guardianship, which would have enabled the Officer to reach such a conclusion (TARGETCASE). ","There must be probative evidence, such as affidavits or a transfer of guardianship, to enable an officer to conclude that minor children could be left in the care of their elder siblings."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [12] The respondent has taken the opposite position. It submits that the words ""par/by Moores"" are not part of the mark used on the labels and that they are simply there to establish the exclusivity of the relationship that exists with Moores. These features render the matter before this court readily distinguishable from the Honeywell Bull , supra, and <TARGETCASE> , supra, cases where, on the contrary, the words used were part of the same phrase or composite mark. Although it can be argued that these words constitute an unclear or uncertain message to the public, the respondent asserts that this does not mean that the subject mark has not been used in Canada. ",The words 'par/by Moores' are not part of the mark used on the labels and are simply there to establish the exclusivity of the relationship that exists with Moores.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [79] The plebiscite regulations in <TARGETCASE> provided that the provisions of the Municipal Act applied to the vote, ""with such modifications as the circumstances require[d]"" (paragraph 6). Justice Marshall noted that two of the irregularities resulted from the Returning Officer applying such modifications due to the limited time available in preparing for the vote. He then reviewed the applicable authorities, noting that elections ""should not be too easily overturned,"" and noting that irregularities will virtually always occur in an election in one form or another (paragraph 52). He then summarized the law in this way at paragraph 55: ""So the rule then, on a review of these authorities and subject to statutory modification, could be stated, in my view as follows: That the vote should be vitiated, only if it is shown that there were such irregularities that, on a balance of probabilities, the result of the election might have been different.","The vote should be vitiated, only if it is shown that there were such irregularities that, on a balance of probabilities, the result of the election might have been different."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [17] Similarly, this Court has held on a number of occasions that the existence of a valid IFA is determinative of a refugee claim and, consequently, the other issues raised by the applicant upon judicial review need not be considered: <TARGETCASE> (T.D.)(QL) at para. 5; <REFERENCE> ","The existence of a valid Internal Flight Alternative (IFA) is determinative of a refugee claim and, consequently, the other issues raised by the applicant upon judicial review need not be considered."

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [128] Clearly, the Court does not have to rule on this given the outcome of the application for judicial review. I would not have been inclined on the face of it to deny the requested remedy given that the rule of law takes precedence and the respondents obviously chose to proceed despite the risk posed by the application for judicial review. Nevertheless, it is neither necessary nor worthwhile to continue seeking the balance of convenience in this case, where the nature of the remedy is very different from that in TARGETCASE, in which the question of law was the central interest of REFERENCE , a non-profit corporation.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [8] What is being alleged here is the failure of the Visa Officer to consider the question of whether the discretion should be exercised, not that it was exercised wrongly. While a failure to exercise the discretion has often been treated as a breach of procedural fairness (see e.g. <REFERENCE> , at para. 8) it appears to me to involve a question of law: namely has the Visa Officer taken every step that the law requires? In either case the standard of review is correctness and that is a standard I will apply to this issue. <TARGETCASE> ",A failure to exercise discretion is often treated as a breach of procedural fairness and involves a question of law: has the Visa Officer taken every step that the law requires?
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [134] Although Apotex counters that its NOA unequivocally states that its product did not employ a binder, it remains that nothing prevented the respondent from alleging further that it was using a different manufacturing process. The fact that it never has to disclose the manufacturing details ( TARGETCASE) before a confidentiality order is issued does not address fully the fact that it said nothing of its manufacturing process.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [13] In Baron , the Federal Court of Appeal reviewed the prior jurisprudence concerning the limited discretion of a removal officer to defer removal pursuant to section 48 of the Act, that is the decisions in <TARGETCASE> and confirmed the principle that the discretion is a limited one, having regard to the statutory purposes and statutory scheme.

Mr. Justice Yves de Montigny held at paragraph 31: <TARGETCASE> ""¶ 31 Finally, the Applicants have argued that conditions in Argentina are dismal and not good for raising children. They cited statistics from the documentation, which were also considered by the H&C Officer, to show that Canada is a more desirable place to live in general. But the fact that Canada is a more desirable place to live is not determinative on an H&C application ... if it were otherwise, the huge majority of people living illegally in Canada would have to be granted permanent resident status for Humanitarian and Compassionate reasons. This is certainly not what Parliament intended in adopting section 25 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act . <REFERENCE> Accordingly, the fact that the applicants have better conditions in Canada then in Guyana does not constitute H&C hardship grounds when being asked to leave Canada. <REFERENCE> ","The fact that Canada is a more desirable place to live is not determinative on a Humanitarian and Compassionate application, and better conditions in Canada than in another country do not constitute hardship grounds when being asked to leave Canada."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [30] I have a number of problems with the Applicants' argument. The Applicants bear the burden of presenting to the Enforcement Officer compelling evidence supporting their request ( <REFERENCE> F.T.R. 248 (T.D.), at para. 24). This Court has held that a removal officer is not obligated to seek out and consider documents which are not brought before him ( <TARGETCASE> at para. 22). What the Applicants are asking is that the Enforcement Officer undertake a review of the entire CIC file to determine whether there is anything contained therein that could support a request for deferral. Where, as here, not one single reference is made to the fact that their H & C application is based, in part, on new risk evidence, it is unreasonable to require the Enforcement Officer to make further inquiries. In my view, without being apprised directly of the risk factors facing the Applicants upon removal, there is no obligation on the Enforcement Officer to seek out and analyze the submissions in the H & C application. <REFERENCE> ",A removal officer is not obligated to seek out and consider documents which are not brought before him.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [23] The defendant points to the very broad wording of the Crown Liability Act. The defendant says that as soon as any pension is paid or payable any type of proceeding is barred.

On the facts of this appeal, I see no reason here to depart from Justice Snider's conclusion.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [45] The Applicant observes that the PRRA Officer assessed the credibility of his alleged involvement with the MB even though the PRRA Officer had stated that this assessment was not necessary to dispose of his PRRA application. Citing REFERENCE, the Applicant submits that an oral hearing was required because the PRRA Officer emphasized the credibility findings of another decision-maker. The Applicant also takes the position that the PRRA Officer did not accept the Applicant's evidence that the Canadian Embassy divulged information to Syrian authorities, that there were media reports bringing the Applicant to the attention of the Syrian authorities, or that the Declarations were genuine because the PRRA Officer found that the Applicant lacked credibility. Citing TARGETCASE, the Applicant contends that the PRRA Officer's finding that the Applicant failed to support his allegations with corroborating objective evidence (for example, media reports showing that the attention of the Syrian authorities had been drawn to his case) amounts to a negative credibility finding.

However, upon reviewing the transcripts of the hearing, nothing suggests that the Board has been insensitive to her circumstances in assessing her testimony, and such a finding cannot be made by this Court on the sole basis of the negative credibility inference. It is not appropriate for this Court to reassess Ms. Gilot's credibility on the basis of its own understanding of her story.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [50] In <TARGETCASE> , the Court of Appeal considered whether a post-claims determination officer was required to disclose the documents that he relied on that were published after the appellant had filed his written submissions, all of which were in the public domain. The Court of Appeal noted that the considerations in determining whether documentary evidence available in the public domain must be disclosed to a claimant include: the nature of the proceeding and the rules under which the decision-maker is acting, the context of the proceeding, and the nature of the documents at issue in such proceedings.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [26] It is difficult to escape the conclusion that one merely visits when not even spending 50% of their time in that place. In the case of Mrs. Olafimihan, 57.4% of the four years, during 19 absences was spent abroad. As for Mr. Olaoye Olafimihan, his absences were even more frequent. That they would have considered Canada as a base of operation for their business endeavours is arguable. It is less so as to whether Canada is their home, at least sufficiently to claim for citizenship in this country. What makes this particularly troublesome is the fact that the pattern of their return to Canada showed that they did not come back for an extended period of time. It is one thing to be out of the country for a long period of time, such that an applicant would end up having been out for more than a year out of four because of that one long stay outside of the country. It is quite another to be literally in and out of Canada without residing in this country for extended periods of time to experience living in Canada. It is in that sense that it can be said that one is merely visiting. Which takes me to an examination of the fifth factor. <TARGETCASE> ","Being in and out of a country without residing for extended periods does not constitute sufficient grounds to claim for citizenship, as it can be considered as merely visiting."

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [19] Every case must turn to its own facts ( Chen , above at para 25). In addressing a sur place refugee claim, the fact that an applicant was not actually a practicing Christian in China does not mean that he is not a sincere practicing Christian in Canada ( Yin, above at para 94). Thereby, the Board had to consider the applicant's religious practice in Canada, which it did, explicitly addressing the documents previously discussed, as stated in <TARGETCASE> , above at paragraph 11: . . . credible evidence of a claimant's activities while in Canada that are likely to substantiate any potential harm upon return must be expressly considered by the IRB even if the motivation behind the activities is non-genuine . . .

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [72] The Officer had an obligation to engage in the Applicant's personal evidence of establishment. As Justice Elizabeth Heneghan said in <REFERENCE> : 11 The Applicant submits that the Officer failed to consider her degree of establishment in Canada and erred in making the finding that the establishment was no more than would be expected of a person who has been in Canada for several years without status. The Officer said the following: ...the degree of establishment is nothing beyond the normal establishment that one would expect the applicants to have achieved in the circumstances. Accordingly, I do not find that the applicants' establishment in Canada is to such a degree that having to apply for permanent residence from outside of Canada would constitute unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship. 12 Relying on the decisions in <REFERENCE> (F.C.T.D.) and <TARGETCASE> argues that this conclusion, made without analysis of her particular circumstances, is erroneous.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: This oversight is all the more glaring since there is no definition of that concept in the IRPA , nor is there any accepted understanding of that term to be found in the case law. The only discussion of what constitutes ""espionage"" appears to be the following paragraphs of Mr. Justice Lemieux's decision in <REFERENCE> where he dealt with the same word as it was found in the Immigration Act , R.S.C. 1985, c. I-2: <REFERENCE> ""25. The Immigration Act does not contain any definition of espionage or subversion and, as noted, there are no cases on point except the decision of the Immigration Appeal Board in Wenberg, Eric Ray (1968), 4 I.A.C. 292, which stated at page 307: <REFERENCE> 'The words ""espionage"", ""sabotage"" and ""subversive activity"" would appear to have no special legal meaning, and they must therefore be given their ordinary meaning. <TARGETCASE> '""Espionage"" is defined in the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary , 3rd Ed., as ""The practice or employment of spies"".","The words 'espionage', 'sabotage' and 'subversive activity' have no special legal meaning, and must be given their ordinary meaning."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [18] Consolidating the line of reasoning that has been developing within this strand of interpreting section 97 of the Act, in <TARGETCASE> (at paras 40-41) Justice Gleason goes on to propose a test for the analysis of generalized risk under section 97 of the Act. (1) The nature of the risk faced by the claimant must first be appropriately determined. This is done by assessing the ongoing or future nature of the risk the claimant faces in terms of whether the risk will continue to be personalized in nature; what the risk is; whether the risk can be classified as either cruel and unusual treatment or punishment; and the basis of the risk faced. (2) With the nature of the risk having been appropriately determined, the next step is to compare the ""risk faced by the claimant to that faced by a significant group in the country to determine whether the risks are of the same nature and degree"" ( <REFERENCE> at para 41). If the risk faced by the claimant can be differentiated under this second step, then the claimant will be entitled to protection under section 97 of the Act. ","Justice Gleason proposed a test for the analysis of generalized risk under section 97 of the Act, which involves determining the nature of the risk faced by the claimant and comparing it to the risk faced by a significant group in the country to determine if they are of the same nature and degree."

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [20] In both <REFERENCE> [see footnote 5] and <REFERENCE> , there was only one patent at issue. One aspect of the invention in each case was the specific thing (i.e. the actual apparatus or the bulk enalapril) acquired before the grant of the patent. Further, in <TARGETCASE> , Thurlow, J., granted immunity with respect to the process claims because the defendant had practiced the process prior to grant. In the case at bar, there are two separate and distinct inventions. As s. 56 applies only to an invention which is acquired prior to grant, each invention must be examined separately. Considering the '350 patent, one aspect thereof relates to bulk lisinopril, and another aspect to lisinopril compounded into tablets. The only intended use of the lisinopril in the '350 patent is for treating hypertension. Considering the '351 patent, lisinopril per se is not an inherent aspect of the invention. At the date of issuance of the '351 patent, lisinopril was known subject matter. The invention of the '351 patent lies solely in the new and not obvious use claimed. To acquire the invention of the '351 patent is to use lisinopril for the novel use, namely, for the purpose of prolonging survival of mammalians with congestive heart failure. There was no evidence before me indicating that Apotex did so prior to the grant of the '351 patent. ",Immunity is granted with respect to the process claims if the defendant had practiced the process prior to grant.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [20] <REFERENCE> Justice Simon Noël found at paragraph 17 that the Board erred by failing to consider whether the risk faced by the applicant was different from the general risk created by ordinary criminal activity: <TARGETCASE> As was the case in Martinez Pineda , the Board erred in its decision: it focused on the generalized threat suffered by the population of Guatemala while failing to consider the Applicant's particular situation. Because the Applicant's credibility was not in question, the Board had the duty to fully analyse and appreciate the personalized risk faced by the Applicant in order to render a complete analysis of the Applicant's claim for asylum under section 97 of the IRPA. It appears that the Applicant was not targeted in the same manner as any other vendor in the market: reprisal was sought because he had collaborated with authorities, refused to comply with the gang's requests and knew of the circumstance of Mr. Vicente's death. <REFERENCE> ","The Board must fully analyse and appreciate the personalized risk faced by an asylum applicant, especially when their credibility is not in question, to render a complete analysis of the claim under section 97 of the IRPA."

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [44] The Applicant is right to bring to the Court's attention the treatment of the same piece of evidence by Justice Michel Shore in <TARGETCASE> : The destruction of house churches in the Fujian province is evidence, in and of itself, that the Chinese authorities do not allow Christians to practice their faith freely. Freedom of religion encompasses the ability to espouse one's faith publicly, in a manner, individually or collectively, chosen in as much as not to interfere with the fundamental rights of others. By destroying house churches, the Chinese government is infringing on that right in a persecutory manner. ... The Board found that the evidence did not support that the Applicant has good grounds for fearing persecution in an unregistered house church. In making this finding, the Board reviews the documentary evidence on the Fujian and focuses particularly on reports of arrests of unregistered Christians in the Fujian and finds that there are no reports of arrests of unregistered Christians in the Fujian.","The destruction of house churches in the Fujian province is evidence that the Chinese authorities do not allow Christians to practice their faith freely, infringing on their right in a persecutory manner."

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [20] A generalized risk need not be one experienced by every citizen. A subgroup can face a generalized risk. This was clear to Madam Justice Judith Snider in <TARGETCASE> . The Court was asked to consider parents in Colombia as a specific group that is targeted as victims of crime, specifically, child abduction. The Court noted that the category of ""parents"" is significantly broad and the risk is a widespread or prevalent risk for all Colombian parents (at paragraph 25). The applicants in that case could not personalize the risk beyond membership to that subgroup and this did not satisfy the Court. Thus, a generalized risk could be one experienced by a subset of a nation's population thus, membership in that category is not sufficient to personalize the risk. ","A generalized risk can be one experienced by a subset of a nation's population, but membership in that category is not sufficient to personalize the risk."

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [29] It is very rare that non-compliance of a condition to the exercise of jurisdiction (or a breach of procedural fairness) does not lead to a quashing of the decision, and in this case, the Court is not satisfied that the result would be automatically the same in the future. Moreover, in the Court's opinion, the removal order was null and void from the beginning; thus, everything which flowed from it was also null and void ( <TARGETCASE> ). <REFERENCE> ","If a condition to the exercise of jurisdiction is not complied with or there is a breach of procedural fairness, the decision is usually quashed; a removal order that is null and void from the beginning makes everything that flows from it also null and void."

In other words, the agency's burden of explanation increases with the relevance of the evidence in question to the disputed facts. Thus, a blanket statement that the agency has considered all the evidence will not suffice when the evidence omitted from any discussion in the reasons appears squarely to contradict the agency's finding of fact. Moreover, when the agency refers in some detail to evidence supporting its finding, but is silent on evidence pointing to the opposite conclusion, it may be easier to infer that the agency overlooked the contradictory evidence when making its finding of fact. <REFERENCE> ","The agency's burden of explanation increases with the relevance of the evidence to the disputed facts, and a blanket statement that all evidence has been considered is insufficient if the omitted evidence contradicts the agency's finding of fact."

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [22] In Suresh , supra, the Supreme Court of Canada held as follows: <TARGETCASE> ""Insofar as Canada is unable to deport a person where there are substantial grounds to believe he or she would be tortured on return, this is not because art. 3 of the CAT directly constrains the actions of the Canadian government, but because the fundamental justice balance under s. 7 of the Charter generally precludes deportation to torture when applied on a case-by-case basis. We may predict that it will rarely be struck in favour of expulsion where there is a serious risk of torture. However, as the matter is one of balance, precise prediction is elusive. The ambit of an exceptional discretion to deport to torture, if any, must await future cases.""

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: In other words, the wrongdoers must take their victims as they are and they are therefore liable even if the prejudice suffered by the applicant is more significant than it would have been if the victim were not afflicted with spondylolysis ( <REFERENCE> , at paragraphs 34 and 35). In this case, the respondent maintains that the conditions suffered by the applicant are not entirely the result of his fall on July 21, 1988, but that his pre-existing condition, i.e. asymptomatic spondylolisthesis, also contributed. The respondent also maintains that the conditions ailing the applicant are [Translation] 'also the result of his personal condition recognized by the physicians and by the applicant himself.' Therefore, also in the opinion of the respondent, under subsection 21(2.1) of the Act , it was not unreasonable for the Board to withhold two fifths of the pension. I cannot accept this argument. The evidence in the record clearly indicates that before the fall on July 21, 1988, the applicant was in good health despite the asymptomatic spondylolisthesis. No evidence in this case indicates that the debilitating effects suffered by the applicant are attributable to the pre-existing condition. <TARGETCASE> See also <REFERENCE> .",Wrongdoers must take their victims as they are and are liable even if the prejudice suffered by the victim is more significant due to a pre-existing condition.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [562] Indeed, <TARGETCASE> , above, involved a change made by the Government of Québec to the provincial social assistance scheme. In an effort to encourage young people to obtain job training and enter the work force, the Province decided that the base amount of welfare benefits payable to recipients under the age of 30 should be lower than those payable to welfare recipients over the age of 30, unless the younger recipients agreed to participate in a designated work activity or educational program. In rejecting a Charter challenge to the legislation, the Supreme Court held that the change effected by the new legislation did not affect an interest protected by the right to life, liberty and security of the person guaranteed by section 7 of the Charter, in the absence of a positive right to an adequate standard of living. ","The change in legislation reducing welfare benefits for recipients under 30, unless they participate in a work activity or educational program, does not violate the right to life, liberty and security of the person, as there is no positive right to an adequate standard of living."

Justice Snider in <TARGETCASE> described this as a ""relaxed"" duty of fairness. While some have held that no reasons are required for decisions made under this provision (see for example, <REFERENCE> at para. 39), I am of the view that reasons are required, given the importance of the decision to the person being considered for removal.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [33] I t is improbable, however, that the Applicant's refugee claim would have succeeded even if the letters and the Applicant's sworn statement had been made available to the RPD. The RPD found that the Applicant had not been consistent on dates and locations of various significant events or the content of the telephone calls with the alleged extortionists, and that the Applicant's actions were not always consistent with his alleged subjective fear. To accept that he continued to be threatened by the Karuna group, the RPD would have had to conclude that he had already been threatened. This is not the case. As my colleague Justice Barnes stated in similar circumstances, TARGETCASE does not open ""the PRRA process to a re-examination of evidence that was already before the IRB or that could have been put to the IRB but was not. A PRRA is not an appeal from the IRB and it does not afford an opportunity to argue that the IRB misinterpreted the evidence before it"": REFERENCE.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [11] According to the existing jurisprudence, the choice of the proper standard of review for substantive decisions of the Board (including the RPD) is driven mainly by the nature of the decision. On questions of law, the proper standard is that of correctness, on questions of mixed fact and law, reasonableness, and on questions of fact, patent unreasonableness. This approach was confirmed in the recent decision by the Supreme Court of Canada in <REFERENCE> . With respect to questions of fact, the Supreme Court stated at paragraph 38: On questions of fact, the reviewing court can intervene only if it considers that the IAD ""based its decision or order on an erroneous finding of fact that it made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before it"" (Federal Court Act, s. 18.1(4)(d)). The IAD is entitled to base its decision on evidence adduced in the proceedings which it considers credible and trustworthy in the circumstances: s. 69.4(3) of the Immigration Act. Its findings are entitled to great deference by the reviewing court. Indeed, the FCA itself has held that the standard of review as regards issues of credibility and relevance of evidence is patent unreasonableness: <TARGETCASE> , at para. 4. ",The standard of review as regards issues of credibility and relevance of evidence is patent unreasonableness.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [94] In response to the applicant's argument that <TARGETCASE> does not apply to the Act because paragraph 27(1)(f) of the BC Human Rights Code at issue in that case does not use the identical terms as subsection 41(1)(d) of the Act (and in particular, the word ""vexatious""), the respondent submits that any litigation advanced despite a previous decision or as a collateral attack or an abuse of process is inherently vexatious and that the provisions at issue in <REFERENCE> were intended to address these circumstances more generally.

Justice Russell in <REFERENCE> reviewed the law as to when a visa officer ought to provide such an opportunity. Relying on <REFERENCE> he noted firstly that there was no statutory right to an interview, or any dialogue of the sort suggested here. Secondly, it was noted that generally an opportunity to respond is available only when the officer has information of which the applicant is not aware. As in Ling, that is not the situation here and thus no opportunity was required to be given to Mr. Singh to address the officer's concerns. Further, when as here the officer is relying only on materials submitted by or known to the applicant, there is no need for an interview. <REFERENCE> ","An opportunity to respond is available only when the officer has information of which the applicant is not aware, and when the officer is relying only on materials submitted by or known to the applicant, there is no need for an interview."

(See also <REFERENCE> where Justice Dawson, writing for the majority, endorses the application of the correctness standard to visa officers' interpretations of the Regulations in the context of discussing other issues.) The reasoning underlying these decisions, expressly noted in Patel at para 26, relies on statements from the Supreme Court in <REFERENCE> at para 62, which instruct that the first step in determining the applicable standard of review is to ""ascertain whether the jurisprudence has already determined in a satisfactory manner the degree of deference to be accorded with regard to a particular category of question"".

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: The issue that arises, then, is how, in a practical sense, a claimant makes proof of a state's inability to protect its nationals as well as the reasonable nature of the claimant's refusal actually to seek out this protection. On the facts of this case, proof on this point was unnecessary, as representatives of the state authorities conceded their inability to protect Ward. Where such an admission is not available, however, clear and convincing confirmation of a state's inability to protect must be provided. For example, a claimant might advance testimony of similarly situated individuals let down by the state protection arrangement or the claimant's testimony of past personal incidents in which state protection did not materialize. Absent some evidence , the claim should fail, as nations should be presumed capable of protecting their citizens. Security of nationals is, after all, the essence of sovereignty.

The Applicant argues that taking such an approach mandates an interpretation such as was applied in <TARGETCASE> , which recognizes that sections 63(1) and (2) afford appeal rights to different groups. The only meaningful interpretation of section 63(2) is that, given that the Applicant had such rights by virtue of being the holder of a visa, irrespective of his ceasing to be a member of the family class, he retained those rights and should have had full recourse to the IAD.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [4] To begin I would strike out the statement of claim in that it is imprecise, confusing and at times unintelligible. Indeed, it is a diverse statement of claim dealing in vague allegations of negligence which lack specifics. It is a statement of claim which the Defendant could not hope to properly investigate or to answer. Moreover, were the matter go to trial, it would result in a proceeding which the Court could not control. I have come to this conclusion even giving the statement of claim a thorough and generous reading in order to try to accommodate inadequacies which may be the result of drafting deficiencies. It has a parallel in the statement of claim which was struck out in <TARGETCASE> at 267. As such it is a vexatious and abusive statement of claim which will not lead to any practical result and therefore should be struck out on this ground alone. However, there are additional and more precise reasons why the statement of claim should be struck out as one which plainly, obviously and beyond doubt will not succeed, being the test set out in <REFERENCE> .

Further, the Principal Applicant would not suffer harm herself if she were returned to Guinea and has, in fact, returned there voluntarily at least once before.

Section 98 of the IRPA states that a person referred to in Article 1E or Article 1F of the Refugee Convention is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection. With this provision, Parliament incorporated the exclusion clauses of the Refugee Convention and, at the refugee status determination stage, specifically extended the exclusion clauses to a ""person in need of protection"" as defined in section 97 of the IRPA .

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [12] The following excerpt from the reasons of Mr. Justice McKeown in Duve v. the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration [see footnote 2], are reflective of the ""number of cases"" referred to in the quotation from Hogan that have held that loss of family support or potential family break-up is not of itself irreparable harm: ""I agree with Simpson, J., when she interprets irreparable harm in <REFERENCE> (F.C.T.D.), as follows: ' <TARGETCASE> (T.D.), Mr. Justice MacKay concluded that, for the purposes of a stay application, irreparable harm implies the serious likelihood of jeopardy to the applicant's life or safety.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [73] Not only has this Court consistently upheld application of the guidelines, the Federal Court of Appeal in <REFERENCE> , above, at paragraph 23 clearly established that the ""unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship"" test is acceptable for an application on H&C grounds. As the Respondent points out in <REFERENCE> , the Federal Court of Appeal cited the ministerial guidelines established for inland processing, and while noting that the Minister is not bound by the guidelines, emphasized that they provide guidance to decision-makers when they exercise their discretion in determining whether sufficient H&C considerations exist to warrant the requested exemption. The Court of Appeal in <TARGETCASE> likewise, held that the use of the ""unusual and undeserved, or disproportionate hardship"" test in the guidelines merely assists decision-makers and does not fetter their discretion: Fourth, ""hardship"" is not a term of art. As noted in section 6.1 of Chapter IP 5 of the Immigration Manual (reproduced at para. 30 of my colleague's reasons), the administrative definition of ""unusual and undeserved hardship"" and ""disproportionate hardship"" in the Manual are ""not meant as 'hard and fast' rules"" and are, rather, ""an attempt to provide guidance to decision makers when they exercise their discretion"". It is obvious, for example, that the concept of ""undeserved hardship"" is ill-suited when assessing the hardship on innocent children. Children will rarely, if ever, be deserving of any hardship. ","The use of the 'unusual and undeserved, or disproportionate hardship' test in the guidelines merely assists decision-makers and does not fetter their discretion."

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [60] In addition, Mr. Bhoonahesh Ramnanan has not demonstrated that there are two equally plausible interpretations resulting in ambiguity in the interpretation of s. 68(4) of the IRPA . To the contrary, the express language in s. 68(4) is explicit and clear that Parliament intended to limit the IAD's jurisdiction by cancelling an individual's stay of his removal by operation of law and terminate the appeal, if the individual concerned was convicted of an offence referred to in s. 36(1) of the IRPA .

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [11] The review of a claim made under subsection 97(1) of the IRPA calls for an individualized and essentially factual inquiry. The appropriate standard of review is thus reasonableness. In other words, ""failure [of the RPD] to consider the claim as it is put forward by [the applicants] constitutes a misapprehension of the facts and the evidence"" ( <TARGETCASE> ( <REFERENCE> )). Moreover, assessment of the generalized or personalized nature of the alleged risks involves applying the IRPA to a specific factual situation, and the RPD's findings are reviewable against a standard of reasonableness <REFERENCE> ( <REFERENCE> ).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [11] The ministerial guidelines are not law and the Minister and his agents are not bound by them. However, they are accessible to the public and the Supreme Court of Canada has qualified them as being of great assistance to the court: <TARGETCASE> (F.C.) in support of the proposition that failure to forward the application to a PRRA officer for a risk assessment constitutes a breach of the duty of procedural fairness. The respondent contends that the guidelines do not extinguish the discretion of the officer to determine, on the basis of the documentation contained within the application, whether a PRRA is warranted. The respondent refers to a number of authorities in support of this position. All of the cited decisions were in relation to the former legislation and it is clear that the guidelines under the former legislation are not precisely the same as those under IRPA. ",Failure to forward the application to a PRRA officer for a risk assessment constitutes a breach of the duty of procedural fairness.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [17] Thus, the jurisprudence of this Court and of the Supreme Court of Canada in REFERENCE, supports the PRRA officer's understanding that there is adequate state protection where the state is making serious efforts to provide protection.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [35] I find that there is no indication that the officer decided the application based on whether the applicants ""deserved"" to stay in Canada, as the applicants allege. In considering the prolonged stay in Canada of an H&C applicant, it is acceptable for an immigration officer to consider whether all or part of that stay was by choice. It is also appropriate to find that applicants cannot benefit from time lapsed while they elected to pursue PRRA and H&C applications: <REFERENCE> . It was open to the PRRA officer to note, correctly, that the applicants' home was purchased while they were subject to a removal order. The test of ""unusual and undeserved, or disproportionate hardship"" was correctly stated in the decision and these findings do not establish that the PRRA officer erred or applied the wrong test. <TARGETCASE> Issue No. 4: Did the PRRA officer fail to adequately consider the best interests of the child? <REFERENCE> ",Applicants cannot benefit from time lapsed while they elected to pursue PRRA and H&C applications.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [383] The Supreme Court noted in <TARGETCASE> that what distinguishes a crime against humanity from an ordinary crime is the context in which the crime takes place. A proscribed act will become a crime against humanity when it is committed ""as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against a civilian population or identifiable group"": at para. 151. As with any criminal offence, there are two components to a crime against humanity: the criminal act (actus reus) and the guilty mind (mens rea).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [8] The RPD considered that this negative credibility finding could be extended to the whole of Mr. Guney's testimony, and stated as follows: <REFERENCE> This leaves the claimant's allegations with respect to the history of three arrests and detentions. However, because the applicant has manufactured one arm of his claim, one of the two bases of his claim for protection in Canada, the panel finds that it cannot rely on the other arm either . That is, the claimant's testimony in general is neither reliable nor credible, and as such it cannot support his claim on any arm, or basis. (emphasis added) <TARGETCASE> ","The claimant's testimony in general is neither reliable nor credible, and as such it cannot support his claim on any arm, or basis."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [7] However, in the present situation, the decision at issue is one that is essentially factual, as the citizenship judge was asked to determine whether the applicant had sufficient knowledge of Canada, as opposed to determining whether the applicant met the residency requirement based on the tests set out in the jurisprudence, which would be a question of mixed fact and law. Therefore, I would follow the decisions of Mr. Justice Michel M.J.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [20] The Applicants submit that because the RPD did not make a negative credibility finding, their allegations should be accepted as fact. While the RPD acknowledged that Roma suffer discrimination in almost all facets of life, it failed to assess the issue of persecution separately.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [24] A number of judges of this Court have weighed in on the choice of standard of review to be applied by the Federal Court with respect to the scope of the review conducted by the RAD on appeal. As Justice Martineau explains in <REFERENCE> umber of decisions of the Court concluded, on the one hand, that a standard of correctness should be applied ( <REFERENCE> [ Iyamuremye ]; <TARGETCASE> [ Garcia Alvarez ]; <REFERENCE> [ Eng ]; <REFERENCE> to 34 [ Huruglica ]; <REFERENCE> [ Yetna ] at para 14; <REFERENCE> [ Spasoja ] at paras 7 to 9).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [16] The leading principles and jurisprudence dealing with the liability of corporate officers and directors are generally derived from the case of <TARGETCASE> C.P.R.(2d) 164 (F.C.A.). Mr. Justice Le Dain writing for the Court determined that a corporate director could not be held personally liable even in a situation where the president and principal shareholder clearly controlled the company and directed its operations.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [87] Each case turns on its own facts. The case of <REFERENCE> and the Ontario Court of Appeal. No doubt, that decision of the ultimate Court of Canada would today have been decided differently in light of its own decisions in: <REFERENCE> ; and <TARGETCASE> Q.A.C. 1, at p. 794, among others. These last cited judgments strongly indicate that today the Supreme Court would be most hesitant about going counter to concurrent findings. However, the court's unanimous judgments, written by Mr. Justice Laskin, in the Canadian Aero Service case, found that the president and chief executive officer of the plaintiff (Canaero), O'Malley, and a former executive vice-president, appointed a director of Canaero, Zarzycki had breached their fiduciary duty to their employer. The judgment as reported at pp. 374-375 of D.L.R. contains this passage: ""The legal issues in this appeal concern what I shall call the Guyana project, the topographical mapping and aerial photographing of parts of Guyana (known as British Guiana until its independence on May 25, 1965) to be financed through an external aid grant or loan from the Government of Canada under its programme of aid to developing countries.",Today the Supreme Court would be most hesitant about going counter to concurrent findings.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: In the early case of Russian Commercial and <REFERENCE> ], in which parties to a contract sought assistance in construing it, the Court affirmed that declarations can be granted where real, rather than fictitious or academic, issues are raised. Lord Dunedin set out this test (at p. 448): The question must be a real and not a theoretical question, the person raising it must have a real interest to raise it, he must be able to secure a proper contradictor, that is to say, someone presently existing who has a true interest to oppose the declaration sought. <TARGETCASE> on other grounds), Lord Denning described the declaration in these general terms (p. 571): ... if a substantial question exists which one person has a real interest to raise, and the other to oppose, then the court has a discretion to resolve it by a declaration, which it will exercise if there is good reason for so doing.","If a substantial question exists which one person has a real interest to raise, and the other to oppose, then the court has a discretion to resolve it by a declaration, which it will exercise if there is good reason for so doing."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [30] Therefore, it may be said that Justice Shore is no longer ""entirely in agreement with the RAD that the standard of review to be applied to findings of fact made by the RPD is reasonableness"" ( <REFERENCE> , above at para 40). The result is that the RAD had committed a reviewable error by using the standard of review of reasonableness rather than that of palpable and overriding error. In summary, according to Justice Shore, the RAD must conduct its own assessment of all the evidence, but in doing so, it still owes some deference to the RPD's findings of fact, because it is the tribunal of first instance and it has the advantage hearing testimony viva voce ( <REFERENCE> , above at para 34; Garcia <REFERENCE> at para 33). In passing, <REFERENCE> Alvarez and <REFERENCE> , above, Justice Shore noted that: The idea that the RAD may substitute an original decision by a determination that should have been rendered without first assessing the evidence is completely inconsistent with the purpose of the IRPA and the case law dealing with the virtually identical wording of subsection 67(2) ( Garcia <REFERENCE> at para 33; <TARGETCASE> , above at para 34) ","The RAD may not substitute an original decision by a determination that should have been rendered without first assessing the evidence, as it is inconsistent with the purpose of the IRPA and the case law dealing with the virtually identical wording of subsection 67(2)."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [26] In the pre- REFERENCE case of REFERENCE, Justice Luc Martineau held at REFERENCE that the standard of review applicable to a PRRA decision was reasonableness simpliciter . Justice Yves de Montigny followed REFERENCE in REFERENCE, but noted at REFERENCE that the standard must be adjusted according to the question being decided. Whether the Officer ought to have required objective evidence to support his allegations is a question of mixed fact and law which, after REFERENCE , is to be evaluated on the reasonableness standard (see TARGETCASE).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [17] As to the presumption of the availability of adequate state protection, Ms. Samuel argues that the Board ignored relevant and contradictory evidence, which, renders its conclusion unreasonable (see <TARGETCASE> ).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [43] The facts underlying the <TARGETCASE> decision bear witness to that dichotomy. In that case, the claimant's objection to the war against the Kurds had nothing to do with his dislike of war but stemmed from his belief that the use of chemical weapons was contrary to the most fundamental rules of human conduct. And yet, in many cases on this issue, the Court has blended the subjective inquiry into an applicant's beliefs with the objective inquiry into the nature of a specific war. This blending of subjective and objective elements is nowhere more evident than in the following passage from <REFERENCE> : """,The court may blend the subjective inquiry into an applicant's beliefs with the objective inquiry into the nature of a specific war.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [25] The visa officer fettered his discretion by categorically stating he never grants extensions of time to file additional information. If the officer had considered the request for an extension, exercised his discretion, and then concluded that no extension will be granted for the following reason, then this decision would be legal. But by fettering his discretion, the visa officer is refusing to consider exercising his discretion, which is illegal . See TARGETCASE: The importance of flexibility in the adoption of policy or guidelines as a means of structuring discretion is highlighted by D.P. Jones and A.S. de Villars in Principles of Administrative Law , where the difference between ""general"" and ""inflexible"" policy is described at page 137: ... the existence of discretion implies the absence of a rule dictating the result in each case; the essence of discretion is that it can be exercised differently in different cases. Each case must be looked at individually, on its own merits. Anything, therefore, which requires a delegate to exercise his discretion in a particular way may illegally limit the ambit of his power.

Their Lordships abstain on the present occasion from any attempt to define the limits of the authority of the dominion parliament in this direction. It is enough for the decision of the present case to say that, in their view, its authority to legislate for the regulation of trade and commerce does not comprehend the power to regulate by legislation the contracts of a particular business or trade, such as the business of fire insurance in a single province, and therefore that its legislative authority does not in the present case conflict or compete with the power over property and civil rights assigned to the legislature of Ontario by No. 13 of sect. 92.""

To do so would be to override the words of the patent as issued which, in my understanding, are to be determinative of the scope of the patent. By the same token, in my view, an alleged infringer cannot excuse acts of infringement of the words of the patent by invoking other words submitted by the patentee in prosecuting his patent application.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [60] This Court relies on the Supreme Court of Canada when it enounced that as long as robust ongoing judicial reviews of detention are followed, long detentions can be justified. Such reviews do not violate sections 7 or 12 of the Charter as long as the process suggested is abided with. The Supreme Court of Canada drew the same conclusions regarding reviews of conditions of detention. It made it clear that even though stringent release conditions limit individual liberty, they are less demanding than incarceration as long as the conditions of release are not disproportionate to the nature of the threat (see TARGETCASE). ","Long detentions can be justified and do not violate sections 7 or 12 of the Charter as long as robust ongoing judicial reviews of detention are followed, and stringent release conditions are not disproportionate to the nature of the threat."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [13] First, like the Federal Court in <TARGETCASE> I think it is clear that this amount was not paid ""as alimony"". It should be mentioned that this judgment followed a decree nisi which had awarded the wife the sum of $50,000, $25,000 of which was payable within fifteen days of the decree absolute and the remainder in three equal annual instalments. At p. 7 of the said judgment Pratte, J., referring to s. 11(1)(1) of the Act, identical to the present s. 60(b), said: ""The word 'alimony', which in the French version of section 11(1)(1), is translated by the expression 'pension alimentaire', has a narrower meaning than that expression: it refers only to the periodic allowance which, pursuant to a judgment, one spouse must pay the other during the marriage.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [29] There is no doubt that Parliament's use of the word ""accumulate"" requires a certain quantitative analysis because it is clear that a person cannot ""accumulate"" an intention to reside.

In fact, three international human rights organizations point out that some of the separated IDPs were actually forced to fight for the LTTE (ICJ Sept. 2010, 9; MRG Jan. 2011, 26; Radio Australia 9 Dec. 2009), while the MRG notes that some IDPs ""had only marginal involvement with the rebels, such as building bunkers in the last stages of the war, cooking, nursing the wounded, etc.""","The process used to screen persons for LTTE affiliation lacks accountability, transparency, and credibility because it relies on allegations made by fellow IDPs and paramilitary groups in the internment camps."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [27] The wording of paragraph 41(1)(d) provides the Commission with discretion to decline to deal with a complaint, stating that ""the Commission shall deal with any complaint filed with it unless in respect of that complaint it appears to the Commission that ...(d) the complaint is trivial, frivolous, vexatious or made in bad faith"" [emphasis added].

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [24] Furthermore, Justice Pinard, on judicial review of the IRB's decision, wrote that ""while accepting the fact that the applicant had filed a complaint, the panel found that his efforts in seeking state protection were inadequate"" (see <REFERENCE> ). The IRB's finding is primarily based on the fact that the applicants did not exhaust their internal remedies before claiming refugee protection in Canada. Even though the IRB based part of its decision on the documentation on the State of Mexico, its finding was not based strictly on that single piece of evidence. Because a decision-maker is presumed to have considered all of the evidence before it ( <TARGETCASE> (CA)) and that it is up to the decision-maker to assess its probative value (see <REFERENCE> , above, at paragraph 7), the PRRA officer's finding is reasonable in this case. 2.

The maximum sentence at the time of his conviction was 7 years. While the maximum sentence was subsequently raised to 14 years, Mr Tran was not punishable by a sentence of that duration.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [5] Thus, in the passage quoted the Member makes a negative credibility finding based on an implausibility finding based on what is understood to be a general practice of the PSB in China. In my opinion, this finding does not conform to the law and constitutes a reviewable error. The law with respect to the making of implausibility findings is very clear.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [58] In fact, the United States Court of Appeals in <TARGETCASE> (Cir., D.C. 2nd Cir.), found that even though the lien holder (in that case a charterer) had a direct contract with the owner of the ""Tequila"" in respect of the damages resulting from a breach of the charter party, it should not apply American law simply because it was the law applicable to the charter party. In that respect, the Court said: ""Rainbow argues that the court below was correct in applying United States law because it was so intended by the parties to the charter.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [47] Section 55 is included in Part IV of the Constitution Act, 1867 - Legislative Power , confirming the conclusion that the act of assent is legislative in nature. While section 55 reflects the construct of a constitutional monarchy, the fact that the power to grant or withhold assent was, in its inception, a prerogative power of the sovereign, does not alter its fundamental character as the final act in the legislative process.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [16] Lastly, the RPD concluded that these applicants had failed to rebut the presumption of state protection, in part, because they had not sought it. However, because the RPD was of the view (on the basis of this selective evidence) that adequate state protection was available, it failed to seriously examine and test the evidence and submissions of the applicants that they did not seek it because it would not have been ""reasonably forthcoming.""

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [18] Over time, several judges of this Court have expressed their frustration with that state of the law and have endeavoured to streamline the jurisprudence. In Canada (Minister of Citizenship and <REFERENCE> Justice Mainville came to the conclusion that the Koo test has become the dominant test and should henceforth be the sole test to be applied under paragraph 5(1)( c ) of the Act .

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [33] Courts across Canada have enforced the general principle of non-interference with ongoing administrative processes vigorously. This is shown by the narrowness of the ""exceptional circumstances"" exception. Little need be said about this exception, as the parties in this appeal did not contend that there were any exceptional circumstances permitting early recourse to the courts. Suffice to say, the authorities show that very few circumstances qualify as ""exceptional"" and the threshold for exceptionality is high: see, generally, D.J.M. Brown and J.M. Evans, Judicial Review of Administrative Action in Canada (looseleaf) (Toronto: Canvasback Publishing, 2007) at 3:2200, 3:2300 and 3:4000 and David J. Mullan, Administrative Law (Toronto: Irwin Law, 2001) at pages 485-494. Exceptional circumstances are best illustrated by the very few modern cases where courts have granted prohibition or injunction against administrative decision-makers before or during their proceedings. Concerns about procedural fairness or bias, the presence of an important legal or constitutional issue, or the fact that all parties have consented to early recourse to the courts are not exceptional circumstances allowing parties to bypass an administrative process, as long as that process allows the issues to be raised and an effective remedy to be granted: see TARGETCASE; REFERENCE. As I shall soon demonstrate, the presence of so-called jurisdictional issues is not an exceptional circumstance justifying early recourse to courts.

Board members have considerable discretion in deciding how much weight should be afforded to the evidence (see <TARGETCASE> ). The Board gave little weight to the report by Dr. Chernick because it found that the professor did not provide evidence to support his opinion and did not indicate whether the people mentioned in his report who were targeted by FARC had attempted to seek state protection.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [26] <REFERENCE> , Mr Justice Evans (as he then was) dealt squarely with the standard of review to be applied when it is alleged that the Appeal Board erred in finding that an applicant's injury did not ""arise out of"" or was not ""directly connected with"" the military service. He found that the Appeal Board was better equipped to deal with such an issue, and that given the context of the statutory scheme designed to enable claims to be decided with the minimum of formality, cost and delay, ""the words defining entitlement indicate that on an application for judicial review considerable deference should be given to the Board's decision"" (at para 26). He went on to state that a reviewing court should resist the temptation to manufacture questions of principle when the statutory language is non-technical and relatively open-textured as is the case with paragraph 21(2)( a ) of the Pension Act (at para 42). As he put it: To ""legalize"" the process by breaking into a series of questions of ""interpretation"" what ought to be an exercise in assessing the factual situation as a whole seems to me apt to undermine Parliament's intention that decision making by the administrative tribunals determining pension entitlement should be accessible, informal, cost-effective and expeditious.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: A detailed definition of ""judicial comity"" is supplied by the British Columbia Court of Appeal as follows: ""The generally accepted view is that this court is bound to follow a previous decision of the court unless it can be shown that the previous decision was manifestly wrong, or should no longer be followed: for example, (1) the decision failed to consider legislation or binding authorities which would have produced a different result, or (2) the decision, if followed, would result in a severe injustice. The reason generally assigned for this approach is a judicial comity. While doubtless this is a fundamental reason for the approach, I think that an equally fundamental, if not more compelling, reason is the need for certainty in the law, so far as that can be established. Lawyers would be in an intolerable position in advising clients if a division of the court was free to decide an appeal without regard to a previous decision or the principle involved in it"" ( <REFERENCE> ; 103 F.T.R. 1 (F.C.), and Justice Mactavish in <TARGETCASE> ; 278 F.T.R. 1 (F.C.).","The court is bound to follow a previous decision unless it can be shown that the previous decision was manifestly wrong, or should no longer be followed due to failure to consider legislation or binding authorities which would have produced a different result, or if the decision, if followed, would result in a severe injustice."

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [33] Firstly, there is no privative clause in the Indian Act or in the Regulations. Secondly, the Minister's review of election appeals requires consideration of multiple interests and the balancing of costs and benefits between parties.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [20] Finally, in REFERENCE , above, Justice Snider held at paras 113-115 as follows: REFERENCEREFERENCE, Justice Lederman described the difference in this way: [...] While the goal of each remedy is the same, the underlying principles are very different. An award of damages seeks to compensate the plaintiff for any losses suffered by the plaintiff as a result of the infringement. The amount of profits earned by the infringing party is irrelevant. An accounting of profits, on the other hand, aims to disgorge any profits improperly received by the defendant as a result of its wrongful use of the plaintiff's property. Such profits, having been earned through the use of the plaintiff's property, rightly belong to the plaintiff. [...] The Federal Court has accepted the principle that ""[i]t is irrelevant whether the defendant could not have damaged the plaintiff just as much if instead of infringing he had taken steps to avoid the claims of the patent: the infringing acts were unlawful acts and the only question is what damages have they caused"" ( TARGETCASE).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [6] There was a dispute between the parties as to whether the onus was on the applicants or the respondent in Article 1(E) exclusion cases. In TARGETCASE, the Federal Court of Appeal states at page 314: There was no issue between the parties as to which party bore the onus. Both agreed that the burden of establishing serious reasons for considering that international offences had been committed rested on the party asserting the existence of such reasons, i.e., the respondent. Aside from avoiding the proving of a negation by a claimant, this also squares with the onus under paragraph 19(1)(j) of the Act, according to which it is the Government that must establish that it has reasonable grounds for excluding claimants. For all of these reasons, the Canadian approach requires that the burden of proof be on the Government, as well as being on a basis of less than the balance of probabilities.

Now, from looking at the materials my understanding is that your understanding is that forfeiture is an all or nothing proposition, that either the whole amount is forfeited or none of it is forfeited, is that correct? <REFERENCE> A. Well, once I've described, you know, carried out the appropriate discretion I have got to make a determination, yes. If I decide that it is going to be forfeited it is all of it. <REFERENCE> 9. Q. It is your own view that you have no authority to forfeit part of it, but not all of it, is that right? < REFERENCE> A.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [7] There is ample precedent for such an inquiry. <TARGETCASE> Justice Blais held the Officer was justified in questioning the origin of the applicant's funds as there was a lack of evidence to show that any of the transactions leading to the accumulation of the funds were legitimate. Similarly, in <REFERENCE> 2002 FCT 395, Justice Heneghan noted that the Applicant was aware of the Officer's concerns regarding the source of his ""seed capital"" and did not produce any documents to allay this fear. She further noted that the Officer was in a position to assess the applicant's credibility. She held that the concerns about the source of the applicant's capital were legitimate and reasonable. ",The Officer was justified in questioning the origin of the applicant's funds as there was a lack of evidence to show that any of the transactions leading to the accumulation of the funds were legitimate.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [41] Reasonableness, not perfection, is the standard. In citizenship matters, reasons for decision are often very brief and do not always address all discrepancies in the evidence. However, even where the reasons for the decision are brief, or poorly written, this Court should defer to the decision-maker's weighing of the evidence and credibility determinations, as long as the Court is able to understand why the citizenship judge made its decision ( Canada (Minister of Citizenship and <REFERENCE> [ Thomas ]; Canada (Minister of Citizenship and <REFERENCE> [ Lee ]; Canada (Minister of Citizenship and <REFERENCE> [ <TARGETCASE> ]).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [50] Finally, I would note that in <TARGETCASE> the officer noted that the applicants had become reasonably established in Canada and acknowledged the support they offered to certain members of the community and two children with special needs. However, she considered that the support could be otherwise provided. Justice Noël held that whether or not someone else could equally fulfill the role was not the proper question: <REFERENCE> ",Whether or not someone else could equally fulfill the role is not the proper question when considering the support offered by applicants who have become reasonably established in a community.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [61] The decisions in <TARGETCASE> ; 2006 FC 287, and <REFERENCE> ; 2005 FC 1518, do not assist Mr. Jayasinghe, either. In Murcia , this Court properly found that there must be a link between the person concerned and the crimes committed in order to establish complicity. The decisions <REFERENCE> and Ardila both concerned Colombian refugee claimants who had been members of that country's armed forces. The panels of the Refugee Protection Division failed to focus on the specific acts committed by the claimants in both cases since there was no evidence to connect them to any unit which had been known to have committed atrocities.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [55] The defendants rightly did not contest Bell's claim, even though it might be considered as a claim in tort for pure economic loss. It was in a common venture with Telus and Hydro Québec and so falls well within the exceptions to the remoteness rule discussed in <TARGETCASE> .

His analysis concluded the following: <REFERENCE> ""(1) The claimant must have suffered from 'atrocious' or 'appalling' acts of persecution in the country from which he or she is claiming asylum; <TARGETCASE> ""(2) The claimant must have a subjective fear of persecution such that he refuses to return to his country of origin and asks for the protection of the authorities of that country; <REFERENCE> ""(3) The claimant must suffer continuing psychological after-effects of the previous persecution. <REFERENCE> ",The claimant must have a subjective fear of persecution such that he refuses to return to his country of origin and asks for the protection of the authorities of that country.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [32] That said, the delegate Kaufman concluded that the case at bar differed from <REFERENCE> (T.D.), relied on by the applicants to demonstrate the fact that the delegate was not independent. In 1993, the delegate then appointed to hear the complaint filed against the trustee Laflamme, Robert Archambault, was recalled before the end of his mandate, with no reason being given by the Minister of Industry, Science and Technology (who at the time had the power now exercised by the Superintendent). The delegate Archambault subsequently lost his action to recover the total amount of the fees mentioned in the contract. The Minister had not undertaken any contractual obligation to the delegate to have a valid reason for recall ( <TARGETCASE> it is worth noting that the delegate Kaufman wrote: [Translation] ""Although the reasons for which I might be recalled at the end of my contract are perhaps not as specific as one might desire, my contract gives me much more security than that which the Minister signed with the delegate recalled in <REFERENCE> ... according to the terms of my employment, I can only be relieved of my duties for a valid reason "".

VIII - Independent and impartial tribunal). ",The delegate can only be relieved of duties for a valid reason.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [7] The fact that the use actually made of the report after its confection may have been quite different from that which was originally intended, while relevant to the issue of waiver, has little or no bearing on the PIPSC's first contention. It is well established that the dominant purpose of a document is to be assessed as of the time at which it is brought into existence as it is the dominant purpose for its creation that is in issue. ( <TARGETCASE> at p. 544 (H.L.), per Lord Edmund Davies.) In this respect, the record unequivocally shows that the forensic audit was originally ordered to be conducted on the recommendation of legal counsel for the purpose of ultimately allowing the Museum to pursue an action in defamation. The record also shows that that purpose was known and acknowledged by the authors of the report at the time of their engagement, and that they were to act under the direction of the Museum's legal counsel. No purpose other than litigation can be gleaned from the written exchanges between counsel, the Museum and the authors of the report. I would have to ignore that evidence altogether and in effect treat it as a sham to ascribe to the report, at the time of its creation, a prime purpose other than that which the Museum contends. ","The dominant purpose of a document is to be assessed as of the time at which it is brought into existence, as it is the dominant purpose for its creation that is in issue."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [9] Moreover, the applicant contends, as stated in <TARGETCASE> at 170 (F.C.A.): ""[w]hether or not the applicant was a credible witness...does not prevent him from being a refugee if his political opinions and activities are likely to lead to his arrest and punishment."" The applicant submits that even where a Board makes negative findings of credibility it is required to consider credible evidence pertaining to the objective basis of the claim.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [3] The reason for the refusal was medical in nature. In the opinion of a medical officer, concurred in by another medical officer, the applicant's son, Haroon, would cause or might reasonably be expected to cause excessive demands on health or social services. The narrative portion of the medical notification states: <REFERENCE> ""Severe Developmental Delay with Biotinidase Deficiency. <TARGETCASE> ""This five year old boy has severe developmental delay requiring a specialized classroom setting with a multidisciplinary team to deal with severe learning difficulties and speech and language problems: his expressive language consists mainly of grunts and gestures.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [10] Further, the credibility finding was not based on this alone. The RPD also noted that the Applicant did not mention the effort by the elders to diffuse the blood feud in his first and second PIFs. Rather, that it arose for the first time in his PIF prepared on June 20, 2012, over a year later. In my view, this was a significant omission because it established that an unsuccessful effort had been made by the village elders to diffuse the feud. This was central to Applicant's claim as it addressed whether he would be at a risk in Afghanistan. It is open to the RPD to base credibility findings on omissions and inconsistencies in a claimant's evidence, including where the omissions have to do with facts that directly concern the very basis of the claim for protection, as was the case here ( <REFERENCE> [ <TARGETCASE> ]). While the RPD found that the Applicant did not offer an explanation for this omission, the transcript of the hearing indicates that he stated that it was because he was not asked. It is clear that the RPD could not have accepted this as a satisfactory explanation. It reasonably found that the addition to the last PIF was an embellishment.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [45] The PSST found that this error was distinguishable from the one in REFERENCE , above, where a change to the maximum length of exam answers, which had not been communicated to the complainant, had created an inequitable outcome. In TARGETCASE , the Deputy Minister of Canadian Heritage had assessed candidates for a job through an off-site examination. Initial instructions e-mailed to the candidates stated that they had to limit each answer to a maximum of two pages. The respondent afterwards e-mailed new instructions informing the candidates that there was no page limit at all and requesting that they send a reply to acknowledge receipt. The complainant did not see the additional instructions before submitting her exam and never sent the requested reply.

The applicant had the obligation to include all relevant facts in his PIF and it is insufficient for the applicant to claim that his oral testimony was an elaboration ( <REFERENCE> (F.C.)

The authorities cited by the respondent ( <REFERENCE> (FCTD) at para 19), do not explicitly require that a law society complaint be made; rather, the issues that have to be considered by the court are whether the complaint is bona fide and whether the former counsel had an opportunity to respond.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [11] However, the nature of the question is key in this application and also brings into play relative expertise. Deciding whether a particular claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection involves ""applying a legal standard [i.e. ""clear and convincing confirmation of a state's inability to protect"": Ward, supra, at para. 50] to a set of facts"", which according to the Supreme Court constitutes a question of mixed fact and law: <TARGETCASE> at para. 26. The RPD has relative expertise with respect to the findings of fact and assessing country conditions. However, the Court has relative expertise with respect to whether the legal standard was met. Accordingly, the appropriate standard of review is in my view reasonableness simpliciter.

The new ground, which was discussed by the visa officer in the CAIPS notes but not in the refusal letter, is based on the adoption's non-compliance with paragraph 673(a) of Ghana's Children's Act , 1998 ( Act 560 ), which requires that an adoption order shall not be made unless the adoptee has been the continuous care of the applicant for at least three consecutive months immediately before the date of the adoption order.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [16] The Applicant points out that officers are required to consider the particular circumstances of an applicant and assess those circumstances in light of the IRPA and the relevant guidelines (citing TARGETCASE). Here, the Applicant asserts that the Officer did not globally assess the Applicant's application in accordance with chapter IP 5 of the Inland Processing Manual , ""Immigrant Applications in Canada made on Humanitarian or Compassionate Grounds"" [Manual]. All the relevant criteria outlined in the Manual favoured the Applicant, and he argues that the Officer erred by assessing them in isolation. Had the Officer properly assessed the total hardship that the Applicant would suffer if he were required to apply for status from outside of Canada, the Applicant says the Officer could not have concluded there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [26] <REFERENCE> at paragraph 28, the Federal Court of Appeal concluded that discharge from employment is an act that takes place, and is completed, at a specific point in time. The Federal Court of Appeal reiterated this view in <REFERENCE> (QL). In <TARGETCASE> , at paragraph 7, the Court held that the complainant had one year from the time of the dismissal to file a formal written complaint. The date when the complainant first contacts the Commission regarding a possible complaint does not stop the ""clock for the one-year time limit"". Mr. Johnston also argues that the complaint should be assessed from the date that he first contacted the Commission in January 2001 about filing a complaint. This argument is without merit. The Commission must receive thousands of inquiries into possible complaints. It would be difficult and perhaps impossible for the Commission to track each of these calls. The Commission has wisely and fairly, in my view, interpreted its legislation to require that the clock for the one-year time limit runs to the date on which a written complaint is filed. There may be circumstances where the Commission may determine that the date against which it measures the time should be different; this is not such a case. ","The complainant had one year from the time of the dismissal to file a formal written complaint, and the clock for the one-year time limit runs to the date on which a written complaint is filed."

Moreover, as the Federal Court of Appeal noted in <REFERENCE> (QL) (F.C.A.), the fact that some of the documentary evidence is not mentioned in the Board's reasons is not fatal to its decision nor does it indicate that the evidence was ignored or misconstrued. This is especially so where the evidence not mentioned has little probative value. Hence, it is open to the Board to assess the evidence and give it little or no probative value. As stated by Chief Justice Bora Laskin, of the Supreme Court of Canada, in <TARGETCASE> : I am unable to conclude that the Board ignored that evidence and thereby committed an error of law to be redressed in this Court. The fact that it was not mentioned in the Board's reasons is not fatal to its decision. It was in the record to be weighed as to its reliability and cogency along with the other evidence in the case, and it was open to the Board to discount it or to disbelieve it.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [76] It is time to put the matter to rest. Proceedings under the NOC Regulations are arcane enough. In many respects they have become a minefield where one party or the other set traps for the unwary or unaccustomed party or lawyer. Going back to Justice Gauthier's reasoning <TARGETCASE> at paragraph 56 I believe there is sufficient basis to be satisfied that her ""initial attraction"" that section 6(5) provided a convenient vehicle for early disposition and not a precursory prohibition against raising the issue of eligibility at a hearing, was the right approach.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [102] At paragraph 12 of REFERENCE , Justice Dawson summarized as follows the factors identified by the Federal Court of Appeal in REFERENCE and TARGETCASE : 12 . . . In both cases, the Court applied five factors in order to determine whether disclosure of the report in question was required in order to provide the person concerned with a reasonable opportunity to participate in a meaningful fashion in the decision-making process. The factors were: (1) the nature and effect of the decision within the statutory scheme; (2) whether, because of the expertise of the writer of the report or other circumstances, the report was likely to have such a degree of influence over the decision-maker that advance disclosure was required in order to ""level the playing field""; (3) the harm likely to arise from a decision based upon an incorrect or ill-considered understanding of the relevant circumstances; (4) the extent to which advance disclosure of the report was likely to avoid the risk of an erroneously-based decision; and (5) any costs likely to arise from advance disclosure, including delays in the decision-making process.

Furthermore, the IAD was not required to explain in detail the weight that it attributed to each piece of evidence and to each factor. The IAD's decision is reasonable because it allows the applicant to understand why it dismissed the appeal. It also allows this Court to determine whether the IAD's conclusions are within the range of acceptable outcomes. In my view, the reasons meet the standard of a justified, transparent and intelligible decision pursuant to the criteria outlined in REFERENCE and the outcome is reasonable. Accordingly, I find no reason to interfere with the IAD's decision. B. Did a breach of procedural fairness arise because of a lack of adequate translation?

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [84] Vice-Chairperson Mooney also declined to order production of documentation related to another job posting involving other individuals. Mr. Agnaou alleges this also raises a reasonable apprehension of bias. I disagree, as it was well within Vice-Chairperson Mooney's authority to find such documents to be irrelevant. Labour boards and decision-makers are granted wide freedom with respect to determining the admissibility of evidence; the decision-maker's choice to allow or to reject certain is not, in and of itself, sufficient to infer bias (see e.g. <REFERENCE> at para 18 [ <REFERENCE> ]). As Justice MacKay stated in <REFERENCE> at para 22 [ <TARGETCASE> ]: Parliament has seen fit to give administrative tribunals, such as the adjudicator or the Board in this case considerable latitude to accept and hear evidence without getting tied up in objections and procedural wrangling.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [31] But, by the same token, it also means that the value of the charges laid in a country like the United States is greatly diminished when such charges are dismissed. In fact, I would think that in such a case, the dismissal of the charges is prima facie evidence that those crimes were not committed by the refugee claimant and that the Minister cannot simply rely on the laying of charges to meet his burden of proof. The Minister must either bring credible and trustworthy evidence of the commission of the crime per se or show that in the particular circumstances of the case, the dismissal should not be conclusive because it does not affect the basic foundation on which the charges were laid. Again, for example, this could be achieved by establishing that crucial evidence on the basis of which the charges were laid was excluded for a reason that does not bind the RPD and does not totally destroy its probative value. <TARGETCASE> ","The dismissal of charges is prima facie evidence that those crimes were not committed by the refugee claimant and the Minister cannot simply rely on the laying of charges to meet his burden of proof, but must bring credible evidence of the crime or show that the dismissal should not be conclusive because it does not affect the basic foundation on which the charges were laid."

Indeed, there is jurisprudence that indicates that the possession of a visa is a factor that has led the Court to determine that such a delay was reasonable ( El <REFERENCE> ; Hue , above; <REFERENCE> ).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [13] This Court has addressed the question of mootness in the context of immigration and refugee matters on numerous occasions. As a preliminary matter, on its face, the judicial review of the impugned decision appears moot since the applicant is no longer in Canada. Indeed, the issue of mootness was raised by the respondent in the spring of this year. On April 3, 2008, the respondent Minister of Citizenship and Immigration filed a notice of motion to dismiss the applicant's application for judicial review. The respondent was of the view that the applicant chose to return voluntarily to his country of origin which rendered the matters raised in this judicial review ""wholly academic.""

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [302] The expression ""in the normal course of trade"" has been interpreted as ""requiring that the transfer of the property in or of the possession of the wares be a part of a dealing in the wares for the purpose of acquiring goodwill and profits from the marked goods"" ( <TARGETCASE> , at 395 (TMOB) [ Cast Iron Soil Pipe ]). Such a dealing requires some payment or exchange, which excludes the use of a trade-mark in situations where the wares are given away for free or donated. In situations where samples have been distributed for free, without any subsequent sales of this same product on the market, courts have consistently held that the alleged trade-mark was not used ""in the normal course of trade"": see, for example, Cast Iron Soil Pipe , above, at 395; <REFERENCE> (QL), 188 FTR 29 ( <REFERENCE> CPR (3d) 322 ( <REFERENCE> handing out of free samples of a product without subsequent distribution of said product on the market does not amount to ""use"" of the affixed mark as a trade-mark, and therefore does not trigger the application of paragraph 7(b) of the Trade-marks Act .","The transfer of property or possession of wares in the normal course of trade requires some payment or exchange, excluding situations where the wares are given away for free or donated, and the handing out of free samples of a product without subsequent distribution does not amount to 'use' of the affixed mark as a trade-mark."

It is well established that reasonableness is the applicable standard of review to findings relating to state protection, as these are questions of mixed fact and law which, given the RPD's expertise on this subject matter, attracts deference: REFERENCE. In TARGETCASE, the Supreme Court of Canada explained what is required of a court reviewing on the reasonableness standard of review: A court conducting a review for reasonableness inquires into the qualities that make a decision reasonable, referring both to the process of articulating the reasons and to outcomes. In judicial review, reasonableness is concerned mostly with the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process. But it is also concerned with whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law. V.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: It is pushing judicial self-esteem beyond the bounds of decency to assume that courts will always, be in a better position to make such findings. The legal system recognizes that some procedures and institutions are more likely to produce accurate findings of fact than are others. Thus for example appellate courts normally defer to the factual findings of trial courts, particularly where there are issues of credibility which are thought to be better assessed by the judge who hears and sees the witness, unless such findings of fact are ""clearly wrong"" [see footnote 7]. Further, it has been said that even where there are no such issues of credibility <REFERENCE> ""[a]n appellate court is not, however, even in that circumstances, entitled to substitute its views for those of the trial judge simply because it would have concluded differently, the appellate court must conclude that he was wrong [see footnote 8]. < TARGETCASE>","An appellate court is not entitled to substitute its views for those of the trial judge simply because it would have concluded differently, the appellate court must conclude that he was wrong."

I am mindful, however, that on a stay application, this Court is not called upon to determine whether the applicant would succeed in his judicial review application if leave was authorized but rather whether the underlying application discloses a case which is neither frivolous nor vexatious and whether the applicant would suffer irreparable harm on a balance of probabilities (see, <TARGETCASE> .

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [8] <REFERENCE> that there had been inordinate and inexcusable delay by a plaintiff with no interest in actively pursuing the litigation. The trial judge thus dismissed the action for want of prosecution. The Court of Appeal upheld that decision, finding it improper for a plaintiff to commence litigation which he had no intention of bringing to a conclusion in a timely manner. The Court of Appeal thought that such was an abuse of process. The appellant, the plaintiff, in <TARGETCASE> dismissal was a proper result. Lord Woolf, who wrote the judgment of the House of Lords, observed that by reason of an abuse of process, through delay and in the absence of any real intention to press the case on to trial, the motions judge and the Court of Appeal were entitled to dismiss the proceedings. <REFERENCE> ","By reason of an abuse of process, through delay and in the absence of any real intention to press the case on to trial, the motions judge and the Court of Appeal were entitled to dismiss the proceedings."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [45] The Respondent submits that the Applicant's argument misconstrues the nature of the H&C process. The Respondent states that an H&C application is not an additional mechanism for selecting perspective permanent residents, nor is it a mechanism for immigrating to Canada for those who do not qualify otherwise: <TARGETCASE> . This would seriously undermine the immigration system. <REFERENCE> ","An H&C application is not an additional mechanism for selecting perspective permanent residents, nor is it a mechanism for immigrating to Canada for those who do not qualify otherwise."

Further, in a Background paper published in 1994 by the Law and Government Division - Research Branch of the Library of Parliament and entitled The Canadian Human Rights Act: Processing Complaints of Discrimination , the author indicates that ""A tribunal may make orders compensating the victim for any lost wages, for the cost os obtaining alternative services or accommodations or for any other losses occasioned by the discrimination "".

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [24] It flows from the foregoing that the applicants' assertion that they ought to have been afforded a hearing, due to their language difficulties, must fail. Indeed, the applicants have been unable to cite any authority in support of their position that it is incumbent on Passport Canada to assist those being investigated with their language difficulties. <TARGETCASE> ","Applicants asserting language difficulties are not automatically entitled to a hearing, nor is it incumbent on Passport Canada to assist those being investigated with their language difficulties."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [16] I agree with the applicant that the Member erred by finding that she had no jurisdiction to reconsider the danger and appearance findings. Section 57 of the IRPA requires the Immigration Division to ""decide afresh whether continued detention is warranted"" at each hearing: Canada (Minister of Citizenship and <TARGETCASE> [ Thanabalasingham FCA ], at para 8. This is also reflected in the language of s 162 of the IRPA which confirms that all Divisions of the Immigration and Refugee Board have jurisdiction to determine ""all questions of law and fact"".

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [26] In <REFERENCE> , procedural fairness did not require the visa officer to notify the applicant of the inadequacies in the materials she had provided: the onus is on an applicant to submit sufficient evidence in support of his application ( <TARGETCASE> at para 9). Therefore, in such cases, the applicant is not entitled to an interview to remedy his own shortcomings ( <REFERENCE> at para 9). Moreover, where the visa officer's concerns arise directly from the requirements of the legislation or regulations, he is under no duty to notify the applicant ( <REFERENCE> at para 11; <REFERENCE> ). Relevant work experience is a concern that arises from the regulations: a visa officer is under no duty to mention his concerns as to the applicant's work experience ( <REFERENCE> at para 12). Ultimately, the visa officer has no obligation to make inquiries where the applicant's application is ambiguous: ""there is no entitlement to an interview if the application is ambiguous or supporting material is not included"" ( <REFERENCE> at para 10; <REFERENCE> [ <REFERENCE> ] ; <REFERENCE> at para 4). To hold otherwise would impose on visa officers an obligation to give advance notice of a negative finding of eligibility ( <REFERENCE> at para 8).

In each of REFERENCE and REFERENCE , the Court dealt with faxed notices of interviews that were allegedly never received, yet the facsimile transmission sheets confirmed that the documents had been received at the correct number. The Court dismissed the applications in REFERENCE and REFERENCE , finding that any failure in communication was the fault of the recipients.

Some of us are former academics, others were in the public service, others practiced law in small towns or large firms. And some of us were in politics.

Our duty is to render justice without fear or favours. <TARGETCASE> ","Once judges take their Oath of office, they divorce themselves from their past and dedicate themselves to their new vocation, rendering justice without fear or favours."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [16] Furthermore, in <TARGETCASE> N.B.R.(2d) 207; 674 A.P.R. 207, Mr. Justice Iacobucci refined this test of reasonableness simpliciter. I rely entirely on the direction he provided at paragraphs 55 and 56 of <REFERENCE> , above, which are reproduced in their entirety as follows: ""A decision will be unreasonable only if there is no line of analysis within the given reasons that could reasonably lead the tribunal from the evidence before it to the conclusion at which it arrived. If any of the reasons that are sufficient to support the conclusion are tenable in the sense that they can stand up to a somewhat probing examination, then the decision will not be unreasonable and a reviewing court must not interfere (see <REFERENCE> , at paragraph 56). This means that a decision may satisfy the reasonableness standard if it is supported by a tenable explanation even if this explanation is not one that the reviewing court finds compelling (see <REFERENCE> , at paragraph 79).","A decision will be unreasonable only if there is no line of analysis within the given reasons that could reasonably lead the tribunal from the evidence before it to the conclusion at which it arrived, and a decision may satisfy the reasonableness standard if it is supported by a tenable explanation even if this explanation is not one that the reviewing court finds compelling."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [30] To begin, I note that there are two issues for which the standard of review must be determined. With regards to the appeals officer's development of a test for ""danger"", I am of the opinion that the appropriate standard of review is one of reasonableness. As discussed in TARGETCASE , above there exists a strong privative clause in the Act and although the question is one of law with precedential value, the Court must respect Parliament's decision and ""must take the statute as it finds it"" ( REFERENCE). I am also of the opinion that the standard to be applied to the appeals officer's application of the test for ""danger"" to the facts of this case is reasonableness. The nature of the question is that it is mixed fact and law, and some deference is owed. Issue 2 Did the appeals officer err in his interpretation of ""danger"" as per section 122 of the Code? ","The Court must respect Parliament's decision and 'must take the statute as it finds it', even when the question is one of law with precedential value and there exists a strong privative clause in the Act."
question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [23] I am aware of the decision of my brother TARGETCASE. In that case the Patent Office refused to accept payment of maintenance fees tendered by the applicant and not the patent agent of record however those fees had not been tendered in a timely fashion.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [15] Counsel for the Respondent argues that, nevertheless, the Member's decision can be salvaged on acceptance of the following argument: The jurisprudence from <TARGETCASE> at para.11], <REFERENCE> ] and <REFERENCE> ] states that even where an applicant's motivation is not made in good faith, the tribunal is obliged to still assess whether the applicant would face persecution upon return. The RPD stated that notwithstanding its determination of whether the Applicant's claim was made in good faith, it did recognize that refugee laws are forward looking. The RPD followed the principle from the decision in <REFERENCE> and went on to consider the merits of the Applicant's sur place claim if he were to return to practise Christianity in Guangdong Province. (Respondent's Further Memorandum, paras. 4 and 5) ","Even where an applicant's motivation is not made in good faith, the tribunal is obliged to still assess whether the applicant would face persecution upon return."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [159] It is also true that section 96 persecution was not taken into consideration for the purpose of the test. Clearly, it was not thought necessary to reconsider a claim of persecution anew as part of the removals process when the refugee claim based on persecution had just been rejected. I acknowledge the applicant's argument that by adding section 97 to the refugee determination process and including section 96 in the new PRRA provisions implemented in the 2002 <TARGETCASE> , there is a certain logic to the notion that persecution should be a consideration of the removals test. Conversely however, it is equally significant that despite the opportunity to do so in every removals decision where a second PRRA application was the underlying basis for deferral, the issue was never raised before this case. ",Persecution should be a consideration of the removals test in the refugee determination process.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: However, she estimates that they will be capable of making the adjustment, and that the parents' decision to move from Mexico to Canada probably posed a bigger challenge to the children than will a return to their home country. She notes that their success in Canada, where they arrived relatively recently, suggests that they are adaptable enough to return to Mexico. <REFERENCE> Fear of returning home : Here, the officer summarizes his own PRRA decision, which concluded that the evidence does not show that they would be at a personalized risk upon returning to Mexico. <REFERENCE> Mexico : The officer remarks that Mexico is a republic with a democratically-elected government, which is taking measures to address the problems caused by drug traffickers and to address the country's security and human rights issues.

This is not appropriate. <TARGETCASE> ; and <REFERENCE> . A review of the record reveals that the Applicants were given every opportunity to state the nature of their case. Lines of questioning were pursued at the hearing that gave them fair indication that personalized risk was at issue and they were asked to provide evidence that would speak to this issue.

If so, the judge must then consider whether damages will provide the plaintiff-applicant with an adequate remedy; if damages will not suffice, the judge may then consider whether, if an injunction were granted and the action subsequently failed, an undertaking by the plaintiff can provide the successful defendant with an adequate remedy. If it can, then finally the judge may consider the balance of convenience in more general terms.

The evidence is that the oncomouse has been patented in the United States and Europe. It is arguable on policy grounds that there is merit to uniformity and that Canada should follow suit. On the other side, there were arguments made against patenting the oncomouse based on human health, environmental and other concerns. However, all that is at issue in this appeal is the interpretation of the Patent Act and the determination of whether, on the basis of the evidence, the appellant's product is patentable in accordance with that interpretation. It is the duty of the Court to take the statute as it finds it, neither expanding its interpretation beyond Parliament's intention as expressed by the language in the statute, nor limiting that interpretation by reading words of limitation into the statute not placed there by Parliament.

Here, the applicant had the opportunity to make submissions on the weight to be given to this factor in her application but she was very brief: her sole submission was that if she was being removed from Canada, her son Philip, who was born in October 2001, would be separated from either his mother or his father, in which case he would become stateless.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [12] The Minister also relies on cases where there was a question whether the reference to a sentence of imprisonment meant the full term of the sentence imposed by the Court or just the amount of time the offender actually spent in prison before being paroled. For example, where a person was sentenced to 4 years' imprisonment, but only spent 10 months in prison before being paroled, was the person sentenced to a term of imprisonment greater than 2 years (for purposes of s 64(2) of IRPA)?

In finding that he had jurisdiction over the claims, Adjudicator Mackenzie held that the provisions in subsection 208(2) and paragraphs 226(1)(g) and (h) of the PSLRA afford PSLRB adjudicators jurisdiction over claims of breach of the CHRA that arise independently from the collective agreement.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [5] As to the standard of review, in TARGETCASE, the Supreme Court of Canada held that a standard of review analysis is unnecessary where ""the jurisprudence has already determined in a satisfactory manner the degree of deference to be accorded with regard to a particular category of question."" Importantly for this case, in REFERENCE, the Supreme Court of Canada held that the adequacy of reasons is not a stand-alone basis for quashing a decision and that any challenge to the reasoning/result of a decision should therefore be made within the reasonableness standard of review. In REFERENCE, the Supreme Court of Canada explained what is required of a court reviewing on the reasonableness standard of review: A court conducting a review for reasonableness inquires into the qualities that make a decision reasonable, referring both to the process of articulating the reasons and to outcomes. In judicial review, reasonableness is concerned mostly with the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process. But it is also concerned with whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [19] Section 41 of the Act was designed to remove some of the complaints from the Commission's workload. As agreed by the parties, the Commission should only choose to exercise this right in ""plain and obvious cases"" and that such a determination involves both deciding if the alternate grievance process was reasonably available, and if the Applicant ought to have exhausted that process before making his complaint to the Commission ( <TARGETCASE> ; Canada Post Corp , at paras 3, 6).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [202] That being said, with respect to the courts' power to examine allegations of discrimination in the context of citizenship status, Justice Iacobucci stated in <TARGETCASE> at paragraphs 51-52, that: "" I am uncomfortable with the idea of rights or entitlements crystallizing at birth, particularly in the context of s. 15 . This suggests that whenever a person born before April 17, 1985, suffers the discriminatory effects of a piece of legislation, these effects may be immunized from Charter review. Our skin colour is determined at birth - - rights or entitlements assigned on the basis of skin colour by a particular law would, by this logic, 'crystallize' then. Under the approach proposed by the respondent, individuals born before s. 15 came into effect would therefore be unable to invoke the Charter to challenge even a recent application of such a law. In fact, Parliament or a legislature could insulate discriminatory laws from review by providing that they applied only to persons born before 1985 .","Rights or entitlements should not be considered as crystallizing at birth, and individuals born before a law came into effect should be able to invoke the Charter to challenge even a recent application of such a law."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [17] Hardship is not a term of art, see <TARGETCASE> (F.C.A.), at para. 9. As the IP Manual notes, the guidelines are to be employed in a flexible manner and do not constitute ""hard and fast"" rules. Guidelines that direct immigration officers on how to exercise their discretion under s. 114(2) must be viewed as ""rough rules of thumb."" If officers were to regard them as inflexible limitations, it would constitute an improper fettering of their discretion, see <REFERENCE> (T.D.).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [27] The Respondent submits that the standard of review applicable to discretionary decisions made under the ""fairness provisions"" is reasonableness ( <TARGETCASE> at para. 7; 3500772 <REFERENCE> at paras. 25-26). Consequently, this Court must ask itself whether ""the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law.""

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [27] It was certainly appropriate for the Immigration officer to consider the sponsor's explanation for failing to declare his family as that was one of the grounds upon which the applicants sought an exemption. Similarly, the Immigration officer correctly noted that the sponsor took the advice of an immigration consultant and chose not to declare his family members, as he did not want to slow down the processing of his application. This was clearly not a compelling reason for not having disclosed the existence of a family member: <REFERENCE> at para. 19. As for the improper advice from the consultant, it could not, in and of itself, excuse the sponsor for withholding material information: <TARGETCASE> at paras. 6-7. ",Improper advice from a consultant cannot excuse the sponsor for withholding material information.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [31] So, also, a governmental or legislative undertaking is not necessarily a commercial enterprise as that word may be understood in certain legislation regulating business and commerce where it may carry that connotation. The filed affidavit of Margaret Jane Balfour is instructive and persuasive in this regard. The distinction was noted by this court in <REFERENCE> (T.D.), at p. 357: <REFERENCE> ""Here surely resides the essence of 'undertaking' promulgated in the two [regulatory] statutes. It imports the aspect of justiciability for failure to meet a commercial obligation and is, therefore, to be distinguished from those undertakings mentioned in the Constitution which signal the division of legislative powers. <TARGETCASE> That question of ""undertaking"" was considered among other aspects, on appeal. It was not particularly mentioned by the Appeal Division and the appeal was dismissed ","The term 'undertaking' in regulatory statutes refers to justiciability for failure to meet a commercial obligation, distinguishing it from constitutional 'undertakings' that signal the division of legislative powers."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [34] It is well established that the appropriate standard of review for a PRRA officer's decision, when considered as a whole, is reasonableness: see <TARGETCASE> . That being said, the standard may shift depending on the nature of the questions raised in a particular case. After going through a pragmatic and functional analysis, Justice Richard Mosley wrote in <REFERENCE> that ""the appropriate standard of review for questions of fact should generally be patent unreasonableness, for questions of mixed law and fact, reasonableness simpliciter, and for questions of law, correctness"". ","The appropriate standard of review for a PRRA officer's decision, when considered as a whole, is reasonableness."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [21] The Applicant also submits that the Officer does not reference any of her submissions regarding the lack of support services for students with special needs, the use of corporal punishment or the economic barriers which, in her view, prelude education. While the Officer was not required to address every piece of evidence submitted by the Applicant ( TARGETCASE) the burden to address contradictory information increases in proportion to relevance of the contradictory evidence to the matter ( REFERENCE). I am not convinced, however, that the extrinsic evidence as to education and health services referenced by the Officer was novel, significant evidence that affected the outcome of her decision. The Applicant's own documentary evidence largely supports the Officer's conclusions. And for the same reason, nor am I of the view that the Officer erred in failing to refer to that information. ","The Officer was not required to address every piece of evidence submitted by the Applicant, but the burden to address contradictory information increases in proportion to relevance of the contradictory evidence to the matter."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [26] In <REFERENCE> , procedural fairness did not require the visa officer to notify the applicant of the inadequacies in the materials she had provided: the onus is on an applicant to submit sufficient evidence in support of his application ( <REFERENCE> at para 9). Therefore, in such cases, the applicant is not entitled to an interview to remedy his own shortcomings ( <REFERENCE> at para 9). Moreover, where the visa officer's concerns arise directly from the requirements of the legislation or regulations, he is under no duty to notify the applicant ( <TARGETCASE> at para 11; <REFERENCE> ). Relevant work experience is a concern that arises from the regulations: a visa officer is under no duty to mention his concerns as to the applicant's work experience ( <REFERENCE> at para 12). Ultimately, the visa officer has no obligation to make inquiries where the applicant's application is ambiguous: ""there is no entitlement to an interview if the application is ambiguous or supporting material is not included"" ( <REFERENCE> at para 10; <REFERENCE> [ <REFERENCE> ]; <REFERENCE> at para 4). To hold otherwise would impose on visa officers an obligation to give advance notice of a negative finding of eligibility ( <REFERENCE> at para 8). ","Where the visa officer's concerns arise directly from the requirements of the legislation or regulations, he is under no duty to notify the applicant."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [20] The case law had clearly held that the application of the remedial provision contained in paragraph 70(1)(b) of the former Immigration Act was a matter of discretion to which the Court should show great deference.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [14] While the Applicant had a question for certification to propose if his application for judicial review was dismissed, the Respondent had none. No question will therefore be certified although, it is worth mentioning that, questions relating to the issue of the appropriate type of review to be undertaken by the RAD, when adjudicating an appeal from an RPD decision, have, to date, been certified in at least five cases ( REFERENCE ; TARGETCASE ; REFERENCE ; REFERENCE ; and REFERENCE , above).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [35] Errors of law are generally reviewable on a correctness standard: <REFERENCE> , above, at paragraph 44. Although a certain deference may be appropriate where a specialized administrative tribunal is interpreting its own statute or statutes closely connected to its function ( <REFERENCE> , at para. 54), the relevant jurisprudence generally indicates that questions of law relating to refugee status (and, by implication, person in need of protection status) under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act are reviewable on a standard of correctness: <REFERENCE> , at paragraphs 42 to 50, <TARGETCASE> maintain that the application of subparagraph 97(1)(b)(ii) of the Act is a question of fact reviewable on a standard of reasonableness. As I explain below, I agree that this standard applies to judicial review of decisions about the application of this subparagraph. Nonetheless, to arrive at this conclusion, it is necessary in this case to interpret the scope of section 97 of the Act , and this interpretation involves a question of law, which is subject to the correctness standard. ",The application of subparagraph 97(1)(b)(ii) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act is a question of fact reviewable on a standard of reasonableness.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [18] None of these authorities assist in the present circumstances. An examination of the court's record in TARGETCASE indicates that the reasons and decision of the tribunal were not signed by the three members but the reasons stated in an opening paragraph the names of the three decision-makers. That decision therefore turned on an argument that the decision was flawed because it was not signed by the decision-makers and not, as here, because the identity of the decision-makers were unknown. REFERENCE is a similar case. There, the tribunal provided the applicant with two documents: a decision letter stating that the appeal was dismissed for reasons attached and which stated the names of the three decision-makers and was signed by them, and attached were written reasons that were unsigned. Again, it was alleged that the decision was flawed because the reasons were not signed by the decision-makers, and not as here because the identity of the decision-makers were unknown. ","The decision can be flawed if it is not signed by the decision-makers, not because the identity of the decision-makers is unknown."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [9] It is not the Court's function to re-evaluate the Board's fact findings on their merits. The Court will intervene where such findings are patently unreasonable, but will not disrupt reasonable findings which the Court would have concluded differently. <TARGETCASE> where I held at paragraphs 4-5: ¶ 4 The Board is an expert tribunal in determining refugee claims. In 2001, the Board heard over 22, 000 refugee claims, allowing 13,336 claims and denying 9,551 claims. Moreover, the Board has direct access to the testimony of the witness, and is in the best position to assess the credibility of the witnesses. Accordingly, the standard for reviewing findings of credibility made by the Board is that of patent unreasonableness, see <REFERENCE> (F.C.A.). In Aguebor, the Federal Court of Appeal said: Who is in a better position than that Refugee Division to gauge the credibility of an account and to draw the necessary inferences?",The standard for reviewing findings of credibility made by the Board is that of patent unreasonableness.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [43] Urie, J.A., proceeded to discuss the leading cases concerning the admissibility of a criminal conviction in subsequent civil proceedings, including <REFERENCE> follows at p. 502 <TARGETCASE> : ""From the foregoing it can be seen that the Ontario Court of Appeal had no difficulty in finding that in a proper case proof of the conviction of a party would provide in a civil proceeding some evidence or prima facie evidence of the fact of guilt, the effect of which may be subject to some kind of examination in the civil proceeding. In both the <REFERENCE> and Del Core cases the courts found that to permit the actions to proceed would have constituted an abuse of process. However, I can see no reason why the same considerations should not apply to cases in which there is a plea of issue estoppel just as Lord Denning and Sir George Baker held in the McIlkenny case, supra.""

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: The Federal Court in <REFERENCE> (T.D.) (QL), at paragraph 15, established, that for adequate state protection to exist, a government must have both the will and the capacity to effectively implement its legislation and programs: <REFERENCE> Ability of a state must be seen to comprehend not only the existence of an effective legislative and procedural framework but the capacity and the will to effectively implement that framework. <REFERENCE> 16 <REFERENCE> 2006 FC 133, the Federal Court determined that the evaluation of state protection involves evaluating a state's ""real capacity"" to protect its citizens. The Court noted that it is an error to look to a state's good intentions and initiatives, if the real capacity of the state to protect women from violence was still inadequate. <REFERENCE> 17 <TARGETCASE> 2007 FC 79, the Federal Court held that a state's ""serious efforts"" to protect women from the harm of domestic violence are not met by simply undertaking good faith initiatives.",A state's 'serious efforts' to protect women from the harm of domestic violence are not met by simply undertaking good faith initiatives.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [17] Medovarski thus does not stand for the proposition that proceedings related to deportation in the immigration context are immune from s. 7 scrutiny.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [13] To demonstrate that the Board's credibility findings were patently unreasonable, the applicants' must show that the decision was ""clearly irrational"".

",A decision that is patently unreasonable is so flawed that no amount of curial deference can justify letting it stand.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [12] It may well be that a tribunal might weigh these and similar statements in the evidence against the presumption of such protection and still conclude that the claimants had not met the burden of proof on them to show a lack of safe protection. But no mention is made of this kind of evidence in the reasons when it was clearly germane to the precise issue before the Tribunal; more germane than the availability of support for FSU immigrants or women and girls as such. While it is of course not necessary to mention every piece of evidence that is presented to a tribunal, when the evidence is directly relevant to the claim in question and important to a determination as to the validity of the claim, the fact that it is not mentioned and analyzed suggests to a court that the agency made a finding without regard to the evidence: see <TARGETCASE> at para. 1 (F.C.A.).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [20] Sopinka, J., discussed the third rationale at p. 362: <REFERENCE> ""The third underlying rationale of the mootness doctrine is the need for the court to demonstrate a measure of awareness of its proper law-making function.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [37] When considered within its factual context, therefore, the exception in <REFERENCE> is relatively narrow. As Justice MacKay noted while distinguishing the case before him in <TARGETCASE> : 41 The present circumstances may also be distinguished from those <REFERENCE> on the basis that the information which the applicant failed to disclose was not information regarding which he was truly subjectively unaware. The applicant in the present case was not unaware that he was married. Nor was it information, as <REFERENCE> , the knowledge of which was beyond his control. This was not information which had been concealed from him or about which he had been misled by Embassy officials. The applicant's alleged ignorance regarding the requirement to report such a material change in his marital status and his inability to communicate this information to an immigration officer upon arrival does not, in my opinion, constitute ""subjective unawareness"" of the material information as contemplated <REFERENCE> . (Emphasis added) Furthermore, I emphasize that a determinative factor in the <REFERENCE> case was that the applicant had reasonably believed that she was not withholding information from Canadian authorities. In contrast, in the case before this Court the applicants did not act reasonably-the principal applicant failed to review his application to ensure its accuracy.

For the purpose of determining whether a hearing is required under paragraph 113(b) of the Act, the factors are the following: <REFERENCE> (a) whether there is evidence that raises a serious issue of the applicant's credibility and is related to the factors set out in sections 96 and 97 of the Act; <REFERENCE> (b) whether the evidence is central to the decision with respect to the application for protection; and <REFERENCE> (c) whether the evidence, if accepted, would justify allowing the application for protection. <TARGETCASE> 167.","No officer is required to conduct an interview for a PRRA application unless there is evidence that raises a serious issue of the applicant's credibility, the evidence is central to the decision, and the evidence, if accepted, would justify allowing the application for protection."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [46] The decision in <REFERENCE> ifferentiates between random acts of criminal violence and those that are targeted. The first represent a generalized risk, and the second a personalized risk. Similarly, in <TARGETCASE> the Court said at paragraph 19, the ""Board's conclusion that the applicant is at no greater risk than other Salvadorans cannot be justified when it already accepted that he was at risk and specifically targeted."" ",The Board's conclusion that the applicant is at no greater risk than other Salvadorans cannot be justified when it already accepted that he was at risk and specifically targeted.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [23] The applicant failed before the Board. He cannot be successful before the PRRA officer if he does not satisfy the requirements of section 113 of the Act. He must ""present only new evidence that arose after the rejection or was not reasonably available ... at the time of the rejection."" As has been found repeatedly by this Court, a PRRA application is not a second refugee claim or an appeal of the Board's decision ( <TARGETCASE> ). The conclusion reached by the officer that the three letters did not meet the burden the applicant carried is eminently reasonable. It follows that he cannot succeed before this Court. ",A PRRA application is not a second refugee claim or an appeal of the Board's decision.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [22] The Respondent submits that in appeals from a case management judge, he or she should be given latitude to manage cases and the Court should only interfere in the clearest cases of misuse of judicial discretion ( Sawridge Band v R , 2001 FCA 338; <REFERENCE> [ Elli Lilly FCA 2008 ]). Litigants face a heavy burden when seeking to overturn an interlocutory case management order ( Eli Lilly FCA 2008 at para 28; <REFERENCE> ; Apotex FCA 2013 at para 5). Prothonotaries are to be afforded ample scope in the exercise of their discretion when managing cases ( <TARGETCASE> ). ",Prothonotaries are to be afforded ample scope in the exercise of their discretion when managing cases.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [8] Arguments like that made by the applicant in this case, regarding the impact of the failure to analyze allegedly key portions of the objective evidence, are frequently advanced in immigration judicial review matters. As Justice Hughes noted in <REFERENCE> [ <TARGETCASE> ] at para 7: This is an issue, stated one way or other, often raised in a judicial review of this nature. What follows in Counsel's written and oral argument is often a microscopic, detailed, lengthy review of every piece of evidence in the record that may possibly be considered as supportive of Counsel's client's case. The written evidence is often presented in bold type and in Counsel's oral argument presented with great forensic skill so as to emphasize and elevate its importance. The conclusion the Court is urged to reach is that such ""important"" evidence was overlooked by the [tribunal] or not stated in the reasons and thus the decision must be considered ""unreasonable"". Often reliance is placed on the decision of Evans J (as he then was) in the <REFERENCE> 157 FTR 35 [ Cepeda-Gutierrez ]. ","The conclusion the Court is urged to reach is that if ""important"" evidence was overlooked by the tribunal or not stated in the reasons, then the decision must be considered ""unreasonable""."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [11] The Court is of the view that this case is reviewable on a standard of reasonableness. It involves questions of mixed fact and law, regarding which the Court must show deference to the officer. As a general rule, decisions of officers examining applications for permanent residence on H&C grounds are reviewable on a standard of reasonableness ( <TARGETCASE> ",Decisions of officers examining applications for permanent residence on H&C grounds are reviewable on a standard of reasonableness.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [31] Justice Mosley then turns his attention to the decision of the minister's delegate to refer the report to an admissibility hearing. He relies on the Federal Court of Appeal decision in <TARGETCASE> to find that the scope of the minister's delegate's discretion depends on whether the person in question is a foreign national or a permanent resident. If the person in question is a foreign national, then the minister's delegate has no discretion to refer the report for an admissibility hearing. If the person in question is a permanent resident, then ""the question was left open whether some minimal amount of discretion was available."" See Richter FC at paragraph 14. In Ms. Richter's case, Justice Mosley finds that the minister's delegate did consider H&C factors and that the decision to refer to an admissibility hearing was reasonable. I conclude from this that Justice Mosley accepts that minister's delegate can exercise ""minimal discretion"" and consider H&C factors without rendering unreasonable the decision to refer the report for an admissibility hearing. <REFERENCE> ",The scope of the minister's delegate's discretion to refer the report to an admissibility hearing depends on whether the person in question is a foreign national or a permanent resident.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [26] Thus, based on paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of section 167, an applicant must establish that there is evidence which raises concerns about the applicant's credibility and is related to section 97, that this evidence is central to the decision on the application for protection and that this evidence, if accepted, would justify allowing the application for protection. <TARGETCASE> ","An applicant must establish that there is evidence which raises concerns about the applicant's credibility and is related to section 97, that this evidence is central to the decision on the application for protection and that this evidence, if accepted, would justify allowing the application for protection."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [9] In September 2004, while in Ottawa for another file, Mr. Beaupré met with an officer from the War Crimes Unit of the RCMP, Mr. Guy Poudrier, and asked him about the status of their file on the applicant. Mr. Poudrier told the Minister's representative that the RCMP investigation on the applicant was still ongoing and that the Crown was reviewing the file in order to determine if criminal charges could be laid against the applicant. The RCMP officer said that until a decision was made on this subject, CBSA could not use documents from the RCMP file for immigration purposes. <TARGETCASE> ","Until a decision is made on a subject, CBSA cannot use documents from the RCMP file for immigration purposes."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [21] Credibility determinations and the assessment of risk are mixed questions of fact and law that engage the specific expertise of the Board. As such, they are subject to considerable deference, and are reviewable on the reasonableness standard ( TARGETCASE). ","Credibility determinations and the assessment of risk are mixed questions of fact and law that engage the specific expertise of the Board, are subject to considerable deference, and are reviewable on the reasonableness standard."
question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [38] There is no basis for the Applicant's expectation that the Officer would re-open the RPD decision. This Court's jurisprudence is clear that the PRRA assessment is not an appeal or reconsideration of the RPD's decision: TARGETCASE. ,The PRRA assessment is not an appeal or reconsideration of the RPD's decision.
question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [15] The report under section 44(1) of IRPA was based on Mr. Beltran's admission that in 1982 he was a member of LP-28. The report goes on to say: <TARGETCASE> The LP28 was one of several organizations that comprised the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (also known FMLN) The FMLN is an organization that there are reasonable grounds to believe is or was engaged in terrorism and/or subversion. <REFERENCE> ,The FMLN is an organization that there are reasonable grounds to believe is or was engaged in terrorism and/or subversion.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [38] These examples demonstrate the centrality of justiciability as a doctrine to demarcate the respective roles of the judiciary and Parliament and its importance in maintaining constitutionalism. The point was best expressed by Chief Justice Dickson in <REFERENCE> , at 90-91: [...] As I noted in <TARGETCASE> , at p. 459, justiciability is a ""doctrine . . . founded upon a concern with the appropriate role of the courts as the forum for the resolution of different types of disputes"", endorsing for the majority the discussion of Wilson J. beginning at p. 460. Wilson J. took the view that an issue is non-justiciable if it involves ""moral and political considerations which it is not within the province of the courts to assess"" (p. 465). An inquiry into justiciability is, first and foremost, a normative inquiry into the appropriateness as a matter of constitutional judicial policy of the courts deciding a given issue or, instead, deferring to other decision-making institutions of the polity. ","Justiciability is a doctrine founded upon a concern with the appropriate role of the courts as the forum for the resolution of different types of disputes"", and an issue is non-justiciable if it involves ""moral and political considerations which it is not within the province of the courts to assess""."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [5] The Supreme Court of Canada in <TARGETCASE> ( Baker ), recognized that this section conveys a broad discretion on a visa officer; however, it held that an officer must exercise this discretion reasonably, paying particular attention to the best interests of the child and that, therefore, the appropriate standard of review of an H&C decision is reasonable simpliciter. ","An officer must exercise discretion reasonably, paying particular attention to the best interests of the child, and the appropriate standard of review of an H&C decision is reasonable simpliciter."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [24] The jurisdiction to strike a proceeding for mootness stems from the Court's inherent jurisdiction to control its own process, and not by reference to the power conferred on the Court by Rule 221 of the Federal Courts Rules , S.O.R./98-106: TARGETCASE.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [14] It is open to argument that Sir James Laing and Re Blyth are distinguishable because they did not plumb distinctions between legal and beneficial ownership. Indeed, unless facts are alleged to the contrary, one would assume the registered owner has both legal and beneficial title. Although it appears that there was some advantage from a Goods and Services Tax point of view for the foreign purchaser only to take title after delivery outside Canada, it does not follow that F.C. Yachts was holding title for the benefit of the purchaser. It was holding title for its own benefit. Although it was under a contractual obligation to deliver a bill of sale once Splash satisfied all its own obligations, Splash had no real interest in the ship any more than the interest of a purchaser, without possession, of an existing ship under a contract of sale which provides that tile is only to pass upon delivery. <TARGETCASE> ","Unless facts are alleged to the contrary, one would assume the registered owner has both legal and beneficial title."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [27] Other findings, however, are much more debatable. For example, the Board found that the Applicant never had a citizenship card because he was only able to point to 6 of the 9 particulars contained in this document. Despite the fact that Mr. Elhassan correctly identified that the citizenship card has a green exterior with white interior and contains his photograph, a stamp, the Minister's signature, and his mother's name, the panel drew a negative inference with respect to Mr. Elhassan's credibility because he forgot to refer to his fingerprint, details of his tribe and his father's name. It was unreasonable to expect an individual to recall every single detail on a piece of identification. Even the most familiar piece of identification contains information that is difficult to completely recall. <TARGETCASE> ",It was unreasonable to expect an individual to recall every single detail on a piece of identification.

(not cited before me), Mr. Justice Létourneau stated: <REFERENCE> ""... unless there are special circumstances there should not be any appeal or immediate judicial review of an interlocutory judgment. Similarly, there will not be any basis for judicial review, especially immediate review, when at the end of the proceedings some other appropriate remedy exists.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [7] The Respondent's record includes an affidavit of the Officer. For the most part, the affidavit is helpful in that it explains the process of the Officer's decision-making. However, the Officer also appears to explain or supplement her reasons for the decision. In my view, this is inappropriate. In rejecting similar affidavit evidence, the Federal Court of Appeal provided the following remarks in <REFERENCE> DLR (4th) 651, at paragraphs 46-47: The judges of the Federal Court have previously stated that a tribunal or a decision-maker cannot improve upon the reasons given to the applicant by means of the affidavit filed in the judicial review proceedings. <TARGETCASE> F.T.R. 15, Justice Dawson wrote at paragraph 22 of her reasons: I observe the transparency in decision-making is not promoted by allowing decision-makers to supplement their reasons after the fact in affidavits.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [72] The respondent's position is that the jurisprudence relied upon by the applicant, namely Hodgins and <REFERENCE> , addresses whether an employer's knowledge of the employee's disability at the time of a discriminatory act is relevant to liability or only to remedy; in other words, whether an employer found liable for discrimination is responsible only for losses incurred after it becomes aware of the discrimination. These cases are not relevant to the issue of determining the last discriminatory act for the purposes of launching the one-year statutory limitation period for filing a complaint. Moreover, neither Hodgins nor <TARGETCASE> involved a complaint filed outside the limitation period. The Commission's decision regarding timeliness is reasonable ","An employer's knowledge of the employee's disability at the time of a discriminatory act is relevant to liability or only to remedy; in other words, whether an employer found liable for discrimination is responsible only for losses incurred after it becomes aware of the discrimination."

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [30] In a post-hearing submission, counsel for the respondent drew my attention to <REFERENCE> a recent decision of Justice Gleason. On analogous facts, Justice Gleason found that the sponsor did not have standing to bring an application for judicial review under subsection 18.1(1) of the Federal Courts Act as he was not a person ""directly affected by the matter in respect of which relief is sought"". Accordingly, the respondent's request to strike the sponsor's name from the style of cause was granted. In that case the sponsorees were three adult children who were non-declared dependents at the time the sponsor was granted permanent residence. Justice Gleason proceeded to consider the merits of the application with respect to the decision to deny an exemption on H&C grounds. <TARGETCASE> ","The sponsor did not have standing to bring an application for judicial review under subsection 18.1(1) of the Federal Courts Act as he was not a person ""directly affected by the matter in respect of which relief is sought""."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [20] With respect to the alleged factual errors, a number of pre- <REFERENCE> authorities from this Court held that the patent unreasonableness standard was to be applied to a citizenship judge's findings of fact. Considerable deference is owed to citizenship judges' findings of fact, as they have access to the original documents and an opportunity to discuss the relevant facts with the applicant. Thus, applying <TARGETCASE> , these findings are also reviewable on a reasonableness standard. I note, however, that even if the patent unreasonableness standard had been applied when reviewing the Citizenship Judge's findings of fact in the present case, my findings would have been the same. ",Citizenship judges' findings of fact are reviewable on a reasonableness standard.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [12] The second case was <TARGETCASE> . In that decision, Mr. Justice Teitelbaum recited at some length the harassment, discrimination and beatings to which the Kraitman family was subjected. He reviewed the arguments put forward by counsel on both sides. He concluded relatively briefly in the following terms [at pp. 71 and 72 F.T.R.]: ""This is a clear indication that Jews were not being offered the protection of the state, that is, Jews could not go to the police for protection. The police may have the ability to offer protection but where it chooses not to, this is equivalent to saying it is unable to provide protection to the applicants. ""To state, as the Board did, that the police response was reasonable, appears to me to be a statement by an individual or individuals with a total lack of understanding of the particular situation the applicants found themselves to be in.","If the police choose not to offer protection, it is equivalent to saying they are unable to provide protection."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [9] ... Gibson, J., in Smirnov states at page 5: ... It is a reality of modern-day life that protection offered is sometimes ineffective . Many incidents of harassment and/or discrimination can be effected in a manner that renders effective investigation and protection very difficult. ... In all such circumstances, even the most effective, well-resourced and highly motivated police forces will have difficulty providing effective protection.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: ""The impugned decision falls squarely within the line of authority described by Prof. Hathaway as follows: <REFERENCE> 'In view of the probative value of the experiences of persons similarly situated to a refugee claimant, it is ironic that Canadian courts historically have shown a marked reluctance to recognize the claims of persons whose apprehension of risk is borne out in the suffering of large numbers of their fellow citizens. Rather than looking to the fate of other members of the claimant's racial, social, or other group as the best indicator of possible harm, decision makers have routinely disfranchised refugees whose concerns are based on generalized group-defined oppression. ' <REFERENCE> and I adopt this description of the applicable law to be found at the end of the aforementioned article: <TARGETCASE> 'In sum, while modern refugee law is concerned to recognize the protection needs of particular claimants, the best evidence that an individual faces a serious chance of persecution is usually the treatment afforded similarly situated persons in the country of origin.",The best evidence that an individual faces a serious chance of persecution is usually the treatment afforded similarly situated persons in the country of origin.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [10] In his forty page decision, the adjudicator reviewed the evidence before him and concluded that: <REFERENCE> - the respondent's responsibilities in the health department were entirely operational and not managerial; <TARGETCASE> - none of the allegations the applicant made to justify the termination of the respondent, many of which were ""vile and serious allegations of fraud, deception and mismanagement"", were proven at the hearing and the applicant's own evidence substantiated that it knew throughout that all of the allegations were completely baseless; <REFERENCE> - the applicant's contention that the respondent had abandoned his job was completely unfounded; and <REFERENCE> - it was plainly evident from the real facts that the treatment of the respondent by the applicant's executive director was ""high-handed and malicious"". <REFERENCE> ",None of the allegations the applicant made to justify the termination of the respondent were proven at the hearing and the applicant's own evidence substantiated that it knew throughout that all of the allegations were completely baseless.

In January 2008, the provision read as follows: <REFERENCE> 4. For the purposes of these Regulations, a foreign national shall not be considered a spouse, a common-law partner, a conjugal partner or an adopted child of a person if the marriage, common-law partnership, conjugal partnership or adoption is not genuine and was entered into primarily for the purpose of acquiring any status or privilege under the Act.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [44] As described by Justice Martineau in a decision of the Court on application for judicial review, Richards was notified after the filing of its disclaimer that its request had been referred to a patent examiner ( <TARGETCASE> [ <REFERENCE> ]). The file was ultimately considered by a Patent Project Officer, who refused Richards' disclaimer by letter dated December 20, 2005. The Officer found that the request could not be considered a disclaimer and should therefore be refused, reasoning that the disclaimer rendered the whole claim broader than what was originally allowed and that it would result in claiming more than what was until then protected in the claims of the patent ( <REFERENCE> , above, at para 21). ",The request could not be considered a disclaimer if it rendered the whole claim broader than what was originally allowed and resulted in claiming more than what was until then protected in the claims of the patent.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [24] I also find that this decision is reviewable on the ground that the reasons are not adequate. The principles governing the adequacy of reasons reviewed under the standard of reasonableness require this Court to inquire into the qualities that make a decision reasonable, referring both to the process of articulating the reasons and to outcomes. According to those principles, reasons for decisions are adequate when they are clear, precise and intelligible and when they state why the decision was reached. Adequate reasons show a grasp of the issues raised by the evidence, allow the parties to understand why the decision was made and allow the reviewing court to assess the validity of the decision ( <REFERENCE> ; Newfoundland and <TARGETCASE> , at para 16; <REFERENCE> , above, at para 17 and see also <REFERENCE> at para. 46; <REFERENCE> at paras. 35-36). ","Reasons for decisions are adequate when they are clear, precise and intelligible and when they state why the decision was reached, showing a grasp of the issues raised by the evidence, allowing the parties to understand why the decision was made and allowing the reviewing court to assess the validity of the decision."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [31] Be that as it may, the Adjudicator did not rely on this argument regarding the word ""touchant"", and it is not the role of this Court in judicial review to create alternative reasons to make the decision reasonable, nor for that matter to substitute its own view as to the proper interpretation of the policy for that of the Adjudicator. On a standard of reasonableness, this Court is only called upon to determine whether the impugned decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law. I am of the view that it was unreasonable to ignore entirely the Application section of the IPP when asked to decide whether indeterminate seasonal employees are entitled to specific benefit under that policy. As mentioned above, it was also unreasonable to rely so heavily on ss. 2.7.3, when that provision was not in fact applicable to the Applicants' situation, dealing as it does with vacation benefits. <TARGETCASE> ","On a standard of reasonableness, the Court is only called upon to determine whether the impugned decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law."

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [19] Prior to the Supreme Court of Canada's recent decision in <REFERENCE> [hereinafter Dunsmuir ], it was trite law that facts and credibility findings were reviewable on the now defunct patent unreasonableness standard ( <REFERENCE> at para. 28, citing <REFERENCE> at para. 12; <REFERENCE> (F.C.A.) at para. 10; <TARGETCASE> (F.C.A.) at para. 4).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [32] The representative of the Wolf Lake Band, Chief St. Denis, introduced the letter into evidence in an attempt to establish that the Band's finances were indeed in a precarious state and to show good faith in the dismissal of Ms. Young. Because the Band was not represented by counsel, the adjudicator was in a difficult position. No one was available to scrutinize the evidence of the employer and therefore, Mr. Brault was the first person who could have advised Chief St. Denis that putting the letter into evidence might have both positive and negative consequences. This type of situation is the result of the more informal proceedings under the Code . However, informal procedures cannot be an excuse for allowing the adjudicator to appear biased. The fundamental question remains the same: would a reasonable and right-minded person who was well informed as to the issues believe that the adjudicator was biased? (See Committee for Justice and <TARGETCASE> ; 9 N.R. 115.)

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [19] The respondent noted the Board's findings on state protection based on the documentary evidence. The respondent submitted that local failures to provide effective policing do not amount to a lack of state protection ( <REFERENCE> ). It was submitted that the applicant's fear of his ex-partner's father's affiliation with the local police was not an excuse for his failure to seek protection from the state of Mexico and its many law enforcement and judicial institutions. The evidence before the Board was that there was state willingness to protect people such as the applicant who are targeted by public officers who abuse their powers. Moreover, state protection can be available from state run or funded agencies and not only from the police ( <TARGETCASE> ). <REFERENCE> ",State protection can be available from state run or funded agencies and not only from the police.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [17] Regarding the second issue, in reviewing the Board Member's analysis under section 97 of the Act, questions regarding his assessment of danger or risk will be subject to a reasonableness standard of review (see <REFERENCE> , above). However, where a Board Member fails to consider and comment on evidence relevant to its determination, his failure to do so has been held to constitute a reviewable error, whether the standard applied is one of reasonableness or correctness ( <REFERENCE> ACWS (3d) 506). Nevertheless, on the basis of Newfoundland and <TARGETCASE> ","When a Board Member fails to consider and comment on relevant evidence in their determination, it constitutes a reviewable error, regardless of whether the standard applied is one of reasonableness or correctness."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [45] This conclusion was reasonable, and in accordance with this Court's caselaw. In any event, even if the applicant had demonstrated that she integrates well into the Canadian society, this factor alone is not sufficient to grant her an exemption: The applicant has the onus of proving that the requirement to apply for a visa from outside of Canada would amount to unusual, undue or disproportionate hardship. The applicant assumed the risk of establishing himself in Canada shile his immigration status was uncertain and knowing that he could be required to leave. Now that he may be required to leave and apply for landing from outside of Canada, given that he did assume this risk, the applicant cannot now contend on the facts of this case, that the hardship is unusual, undeserved or disproportionate. <TARGETCASE> at para. 22 (F.C.).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [38] The Applicant has argued that the Board ignored evidence because it did not cite the documentary evidence that house churches in Jilin and Fujian were destroyed. The Applicant is essentially arguing that the Board should have given more weight to this portion of the country conditions.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [38] I therefore conclude that although the 239 patent may give Torcan the exclusive right to the use of protected piperazine to obtain higher yields and purity in producing norfloxacin, making norfloxacin using the Torcan process still incorporates using the process claimed in the 961 patent. 4. <REFERENCE> allegation of noninfringement of the 961 patent is not justified because protected piperazine plays a role in the reaction that is substantially different from that of piperazine.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [43] The line of cases that argues that the court should undertake a balancing between the gravity of the crime and the risk of persecution is of less judicial weight. The applicant cites <TARGETCASE> (hereinafter Ward ), in support of the proposition that a criminal past should not be a reason to estop a claimant from obtaining refugee status. [see footnote 8] In Ministre de l'Emploi et de l' <REFERENCE> (F.C.A.), a 1992 decision, the Federal Court of Appeal held that the application of an exclusion clause to a particular claimant is never automatic and will always require an assessment of the circumstances and the situation as a whole - including the question of inclusion in Article 1 <REFERENCE> Imm. L.R.(2d) 244 (T.D.), a decision of Jerome, A.C.J., the court noted that once the Immigration and Refugee Board finds that a claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution, it must be extremely cautious - in light of the potential danger faced by the claimant - in its application of the exclusion clause.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [12] On the first issue, the rejection as implausible of the applicant's allegations regarding certain actions allegedly taken by Nigerian authorities, while I might not have drawn the same conclusions on the totality of the evidence that was before the CRDD, I am satisfied that the conclusions drawn by it were reasonably open to it. <TARGETCASE> (F.C.A.), Décary, J.A., speaking for the Federal Court of Appeal stated: ""There is no longer any doubt that the Refugee Division, which is a specialized tribunal, has complete jurisdiction to determine the plausibility of testimony: who is in a better position than the Refugee Division to gauge the credibility of an account and to draw the necessary inferences? As long as the inferences drawn by the tribunal are not so unreasonable as to warrant our intervention, its findings are not open to judicial review. In Giron [(1992), 143 N.R. 238 (F.C.A.)], the Court merely observed that in the area of plausibility, the unreasonableness of a decision may be more palpable, and so more easily identifiable, since the account appears on the face of the record. In our opinion, Giron in no way reduces the burden that rests on an appellant, of showing that the inferences drawn by the Refugee Division could not reasonably have been drawn.""

While Justice Phelan does not indicate the level of deference that would be owed to the RPD's credibility finding, Justice Locke, citing Justice Phelan, refers to the RAD as having erred in concluding a reasonableness standard was applicable to the RPD decision, 37 Justices Shore ( REFERENCE and TARGETCASE ) and Roy ( REFERENCE ) are rather of the view that the RAD owes deference to the RPD on all questions of fact and mixed law and fact, not just on credibility findings or on matters where the RPD enjoys a particular advantage in reaching such a conclusion.","The RAD owes deference to the RPD on all questions of fact and mixed law and fact, not just on credibility findings or on matters where the RPD enjoys a particular advantage in reaching such a conclusion."

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [17] Essentially, our case law indicates that the alleged risk may personalized either because of its targeted or unusual nature (as opposed to a random and systematic risk) or because of its extent. In <REFERENCE> , above, at paragraph 34, the Court mentioned that repetitive nature of the threats against the applicants was a continuation of the extortion and the generalized risk of violence that all citizens of the country face. Similarly in <REFERENCE> , above, at paragraphs 12-15, the Court determined that the continual threats and assaults against the applicant over an extended period of time should have been considered by the RPD before it determined that the applicant was not subjected to a risk greater than the risk faced generally by the population at large (see also <REFERENCE> ). In <REFERENCE> , above, at paragraph 34, Justice Kelen distinguished <TARGETCASE> by stating that unlike in that case, ""[t]here is no evidence that the maras personally targeted the applicants or that they face a greater risk then other small business owners or persons perceived to be relatively wealthy"". ","An alleged risk may be personalized due to its targeted or unusual nature, or its extent, and not being subjected to a risk greater than the risk faced generally by the population does not necessarily mean the individual was not personally targeted."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [128] Although the factual situation in <TARGETCASE> , supra, differs from that presently in issue, the decision is relevant insofar as it recognizes the right of a state to screen potential entrants seeking admission within its borders. The process of assessing medical examinations for the purpose of determining excessive demands upon existing Canadian health services is an aspect of the screening process to which potential immigrants are subject. In my opinion, this is not within the enumerated grounds of s. 15(1) nor is it analogous to it. The Contextual Factors ","The state has the right to screen potential entrants seeking admission within its borders, including assessing medical examinations to determine excessive demands upon existing health services."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [36] The Applicants further submit in <REFERENCE> ; 254 N.R. 388 (F.C.A.), at para. 4, the Federal Court of Appeal held that the RPD is under an obligation to consider the applicability of what is now subsection 108(4) once it is satisfied that refugee status cannot be claimed because of a change in country conditions. However, what the Applicants fail to point out, and as was noted by Justice Mosely in <REFERENCE> , the Court of Appeal <TARGETCASE> went on to clarify that this obligation only arises once the RPD ""concludes that a claimant has suffered past persecution"" ( <REFERENCE> , at para. 6). As reflected in the cases cited at paragraph 31 above, this requirement that an explicit or implicit finding of past persecution by the relevant decision-maker is a precondition to the potential application of subsection 108(4) has been consistently affirmed. <REFERENCE> ",The obligation to consider the applicability of subsection 108(4) only arises once the Refugee Protection Division concludes that a claimant has suffered past persecution.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [10] When reviewing a credibility finding, it must be kept in mind that an administrative tribunal is in an advantageous position for assessing the credibility of witnesses, accordingly, the Court must show deference when reviewing findings of this kind ( <TARGETCASE> (TD) at paras 7 to 9). The Court will only intervene in a credibility finding if the decision-maker based its decision on ""an erroneous finding of fact made in a perverse or capricious manner or if it made its decision without regard to the material before it"" ( <REFERENCE> , above).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [14] Regardless, the two parties agree that the analysis of the reasonability of the decision rendered by the panel must be carried out according to the former section 4 because the visa officer rendered his decision under the former version of this provision.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [52] More recently, in <TARGETCASE> Iacobucci, C.J. (as he then was), for the Federal Court of Appeal was even more direct in stating at p. 2: ""We are also of the view that the interpretation of s. 61.5(9)(a) of the Canada Labour Code ... cannot be read down so as to limit the compensation that an adjudicator is empowered to award to an employee to the amount that could be claimed under the common law: <REFERENCE> dismissal is entitled to set the amount of the award. The award is intended to compensate the employee for damages actually suffered as a result of the dismissal.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [44] The OP-1 Manual is a guideline, not law. As such, it can enable an agency to deal with a problem comprehensively and proactively, rather than incrementally and reactively on a case by case basis (see REFERENCE). It can also be of assistance to the Court because guidelines may validly influence a decision maker's conduct and may therefore help in assessing whether a decision is reasonable or not (see REFERENCE).

The main issue in this case is not simply whether the applicant sustained a fall in 1959, or a back strain in 1961. The issue here is whether the current permanent disability for which the applicant is seeking pension entitlement - lumbar disc disease - was directly caused by these injuries or incidents.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [15] The Board's finding that the applicants had not established a nexus between their fears and one of the five enumerated Convention grounds outlined in section 96 of the Act was reasonable. It is well established that victims of crime individually cannot establish a nexus to a Convention ground: see <REFERENCE> ; and <TARGETCASE> . The fact that a number of people experience the same risk does not transform the risk from one of crime to one of persecution within the meaning of section 96. Accordingly, the Board did not err in analysing the applicants' claims only under s.97.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [17] Despite not being satisfied with his identity demonstration, the RPD continued with its analysis, concluding that even had the applicant sufficiently demonstrated his identity, his refugee claim would still have been denied because it lacked credibility. Notably, the RPD drew negative inferences from the fact that the applicant had amended his original Basis of Claim form [BOC] to reflect that his father's stroke occurred between his two arrests (and not following his second arrest). The Board considered this to be a significant event in the applicant's life, and so he should not have made a chronological error in this respect. <TARGETCASE> ","An applicant's refugee claim can be denied due to lack of credibility, even if the applicant has sufficiently demonstrated his identity."

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [20] The standard of review analysis prescribed by the Supreme Court of Canada in <REFERENCE> requires the Court to first ask whether the existing jurisprudence has satisfactorily determined the degree of deference on the issue. If the existing jurisprudence is unfruitful, then the Court must determine the appropriate standard having regard to the presence of any statutory direction in the form of a privative clause, whether the decision turns on determinations which are primarily factual or legal in nature, and whether or not there is a discrete administrative regime with respect to which the decision-maker has particular expertise.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [17] The Supreme Court of Canada stated in <REFERENCE> (at para 9) that the Canada Pension Plan is not a social welfare scheme. It was designed to provide social insurance for Canadians who experience a loss of earnings owing to retirement, disability, or the death of a wage-earning spouse or parent.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [40] The Applicant says that while a tribunal need not refer to every piece of evidence presented, the more significant a piece of evidence is, the more likely it is that the failure to refer to it will result in a finding that the decision was unreasonable, especially when it appears to contradict a finding of the Board. The Board had an obligation to assess the evidence that contradicted its findings and explain why that evidence did not alter its conclusion: TARGETCASE; REFERENCE.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [12] In its decision, the RAD first discussed the RAD's role as an appeal tribunal and the standard of review applicable to questions of fact and questions of mixed fact and law as well as to pure questions of law. Relying on the decision in <REFERENCE> the RAD stated that, except for questions of law or questions of natural justice, the members of the RAD had to show deference to the decisions of the RPD by applying the standard of reasonableness. The RPD is better situated to make factual findings owing to its extensive exposure to the evidence, the advantage of hearing testimony viva voce , and its familiarity with the case as a whole ( <TARGETCASE> ).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [18] The factors relevant in determining the standard of review applicable in a judicial review proceeding were recently set out in <TARGETCASE> D.L.R.(4th) 193. The overriding consideration is the intention of the legislature: did it intend that a reviewing court accord the decision under review deference, or was a full right of appeal intended, or does the relevant standard fall somewhere on the spectrum that lies between these two poles. Also, the standard of review must be determined by reference to the specific nature of the decision under review. The same standard will not necessarily apply to all decisions of the same decision-maker. The factors to be assessed according to Pushpanathan are: (1) the legislative provisions governing the review process, including whether there is a privative clause; (2) the degree of expertise of the tribunal with respect to the question in issue, as compared to the degree of expertise the reviewing court has on that subject; (3) the purpose of the legislation and the nature of the decision-maker; that is, whether the decision-maker is balancing public policy considerations (sometimes vaguely worded) as opposed to adjudicating the rights of individuals; (4) the nature of the decision under review, including whether it is a question of law or a question of fact. ","The standard of review in a judicial review proceeding is determined by the intention of the legislature, the specific nature of the decision under review, and factors including the legislative provisions governing the review process, the expertise of the tribunal versus the reviewing court, the purpose of the legislation and nature of the decision-maker, and the nature of the decision under review."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [11] In the present case, the main issue is whether a combination of farming and accountancy can be considered to be the defendant's chief source of income for the taxation years 1980 to 1985. Such a determination requires a relative and objective comparison of the criteria outlined in <REFERENCE> , supra. If farming was not the defendant's major preoccupation, in the sense that his accounting practice was not a mere sideline business, the farming and accounting businesses will not, in combination, be sufficient to establish the defendant as a Class I farmer within the meaning of s. 31(1) of the Act . In addition to the case of <TARGETCASE> , supra, I have also considered the following decisions: <REFERENCE> (F.C.T.D.), affd.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [20] Generally speaking, errors of fact are assessed against a standard of patent unreasonableness. But paragraph 18.1(4)(d) of the Federal Courts Act allows for a variety of standards, depending on the precise allegation made. As Justice Barbara Reed stated in <REFERENCE> , at paragraph 19: <REFERENCE> ""… While there has been some indication in the jurisprudence that paragraph 18.1(4)(d) of the Federal Court Act requires 'patent unreasonability', this was not the test applied in Pushpanathan , or more recently in <TARGETCASE> . I note that the phrases in paragraph 18.1(4)(d) are disjunctive; one asks whether the decision under review was based on a finding of fact that was made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before the decision-maker. That is, insofar as the review of decisions by reference to their underlying facts is concerned, the statutory mandate allows for a spectrum of review from one which involves a high degree of deference (perversity or capriciousness must be shown) to one in which correctness or reasonableness may be the test (the decision-maker did not exhibit regard for the material before it). When the review relates to questions of law, however, in paragraph 18.1(4)(c) a spectrum is not provided. <REFERENCE> ","The statutory mandate allows for a spectrum of review from one which involves a high degree of deference to one in which correctness or reasonableness may be the test, depending on whether the decision under review was based on a finding of fact that was made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before the decision-maker."

It is not a privilege or a luxury but a necessity. Possession of a passport offers citizens the freedom to travel and to earn a livelihood in the global economy.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [3] Ms. Lusina retained counsel in relation to the termination of her employment. In May of 2001, negotiations regarding an acceptable severance package began. Ms. Lusina's counsel suggested that 18 - 24 months salary, in lieu of notice, was reasonable. On August 11, 2001, Ms. Lusina wrote to the CHRC alleging discriminatory conduct by Bell. She informed her lawyer that she had done so. On October 19th, she requested that Bell deal directly with her rather than through her counsel. The negotiations continued. On November 26th, Bell presented a ""final"" offer. On November 29th, Ms. Lusina contacted the CHRC about amending her complaint. She spoke with CHRC counsel, Céline Harrington, and in the course of their discussion regarding potential amendments to her complaint, Ms. Lusina informed Ms. Harrington about the settlement offer and inquired as to whether it could affect her human rights complaint. Ms. Harrington advised that, normally, releases are attached to such packages and Bell would ""likely object based on that release"". Ms. Harrington also stated that while it is generally the view that one cannot sign away human rights, she could not guarantee that the settlement would not have an impact. <TARGETCASE> ","One cannot generally sign away human rights, but a settlement could potentially impact a human rights complaint."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [6] The leading case is the recent decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in <TARGETCASE> in which Binnie, J., delivered the unanimous decision for the Court. Binnie, J., wrote at paragraphs 1, and 28 to 32: ""1. BINNIE, J.:- An Anton Piller order bears an uncomfortable resemblance to a private search warrant. No notice is given to the party against whom it is issued. Indeed, defendants usually first learn of them when they are served and executed, without having had an opportunity to challenge them or the evidence on which they were granted. The defendant may have no idea a claim is even pending. The order is not placed in the hands of a public authority for execution, but authorizes a private party to insist on entrance to the premises of its opponent to conduct a surprise search, the purpose of which is to seize and preserve evidence to further its claim in a private dispute.","An Anton Piller order authorizes a private party to insist on entrance to the premises of its opponent to conduct a surprise search, the purpose of which is to seize and preserve evidence to further its claim in a private dispute."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [35] The view that the existence of a band is irrelevant is inconsistent with the express wording used in article 4(b) of the Membership Code which refers to choosing ""to become a member of either another Indian Nation or band under the Indian Act [...]"". The word ""band"" is defined in the Indian Act and the reference to the Indian Act in article 4(b) of the Membership Code means, in my view, that the intent was that to lose one's membership in the Lubicon Nation one must choose to join an entity that is a band as defined in the Indian Act . <TARGETCASE> ",To lose one's membership in the Lubicon Nation one must choose to join an entity that is a band as defined in the Indian Act.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [6] The applicant contends that the panel erred by finding that the fact that he had been targeted in Haiti in the past, particularly after his return from Canada in 2005, did not personalize his risk. In support of this argument, he states that in <TARGETCASE> [ <REFERENCE> ], the Court held that the fact that a young Salvadorian man had been repeatedly approached by a street gang (associated with MARAS) that was seeking to recruit members personalized his risk of being approached again by this gang (see also <REFERENCE> for a similar decision in the case of a Guatemalan citizen).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [11] The RPD also found that, on a balance of probabilities, if Ms Liu were to be pursued by authorities in China, it would be because she violated Chinese law and not because she holds a particular belief or that she opposes government policies. Furthermore, it found that the sanctions imposed on Ms Liu would involve fines, threats, and harassment, and fall short of establishing that she would be subjected to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment and risk of torture. The RPD concluded that, should Ms Liu return to China, she would be at risk of prosecution rather than persecution. The RPD further referred to a decision by Justice Eleanor Dawson (as she was then) in TARGETCASE, where she noted that evidence did not support that those who sympathize with or associate with Falun Gong practitioners and are subsequently arrested are subjected to cruel and unusual punishment. ",Evidence did not support that those who sympathize with or associate with Falun Gong practitioners and are subsequently arrested are subjected to cruel and unusual punishment.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [8] The RPD had concluded that the Deb family did not establish that they would be at risk everywhere in Bangladesh and that it would be unreasonable to expect them to relocate in Dhaka and resume their lives there. The RAD rejected the Deb family's argument that by leaving their ancestral property, their fundamental human rights have been denied.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [27] The process of applying for a disability pension involves not only an initial consideration of an application, but a second review of the application if an applicant is dissatisfied with the Minister's decision at first instance. Following this second review, an applicant is then entitled as of right to a further appeal to a Review Tribunal. With leave, an additional de novo appeal is available before the Board. This generous appeals process is set out in the Plan, and is detailed below. <TARGETCASE> ","An applicant for a disability pension is entitled to a second review of the application, a further appeal to a Review Tribunal, and with leave, an additional de novo appeal before the Board."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [6] The right to a proper interpretation finds its root in section 14 of the Charter . While this section was deemed to be applicable in criminal proceedings for the accused, it is well established that this right is also at play in administrative and immigration proceedings ( <REFERENCE> ("" <REFERENCE> ""); see for example <TARGETCASE> ).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [19] The respondent, the applicant and the Board all refer to the same case law and principles in setting out what the appropriate law to apply is in the present case. For example, the Board citing <REFERENCE> ; 84 F.T.R. 227 (T.D.), at para. 22 (T.D.) ( Gutierrez ) referred to the fact that there are three prerequisites to making a finding of complicity, including: <REFERENCE> ""1) membership in an organization which committed international offences as a continuous and regular part of its operation; <REFERENCE> ""2) personal and knowing participation ; and <REFERENCE> ""3) failure to dissociate from the organization at the earliest safe opportunity.""

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [34] The Applicants claim that the Officer completely failed to address the risk posed by Hezbollah. The Applicants argue that the Officer ""specifically indicated that the 'only' risks brought forward were those advanced at the RPD,"" and since the second ground of risk was not before the RPD, the Officer must have failed to consider it. The Applicants rely on the following paragraphs from <TARGETCASE> Imm LR (3d) 256 [ <REFERENCE> ], to show that this was a reviewable error: ",An officer's failure to consider a ground of risk not presented before the RPD constitutes a reviewable error.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [40] In Canada, sexual interference is assimilated with sexual aggression and is considered a serious and violent crime even when no actual force is used ( TARGETCASE). Even when no force is used during sexual aggression, it is always considered violent because it is without the consent of the victim ( REFERENCE).

question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [15] This application raises the following issues that arise from the applicant's claims: <REFERENCE> a. Did the PRRA officer err in concluding that the applicant's PIF constituted a statement of his allegations rather than a piece of evidence? <REFERENCE> b. Did the PRRA officer err when he deemed the letter from the applicant's mother not to be credible and drew negative inferences with regard to it? <REFERENCE> c. Did the PRRA officer err in his overall assessment of the evidence? <REFERENCE> d.

I would answer the certified questions as follows: <TARGETCASE> A refugee who claims that the state protection is inadequate or non-existent bears the evidentiary burden of adducing evidence to that effect and the legal burden of persuading the trier of fact that his or her claim in this respect is founded. The standard of proof applicable is the balance of probabilities and there is no requirement of a higher degree of probability than what that standard usually requires. As for the quality of the evidence required to rebut the presumption of state protection, the presumption is rebutted by clear and convincing evidence that the state protection is inadequate or non-existent. <REFERENCE> ","A refugee claiming inadequate or non-existent state protection bears the evidentiary burden of proof and must persuade the trier of fact that their claim is founded, with the standard of proof being the balance of probabilities.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [12] The Supreme Court of Canada in <TARGETCASE> held that a standard of review analysis need not be conducted in every instance. Instead, where the standard of review applicable to the particular question before the court is well-settled by past jurisprudence, the reviewing court may adopt that standard of review. Only where this search proves fruitless must the reviewing court undertake a consideration of the four factors comprising the standard of review analysis. <REFERENCE> ","A standard of review analysis need not be conducted in every instance, instead, where the standard of review applicable to the particular question before the court is well-settled by past jurisprudence, the reviewing court may adopt that standard of review."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [20] According to <TARGETCASE> , determinations of medical inadmissibility based on excessive demands require an individualized assessment of the person's condition, capabilities and actual needs, together with the availability of family support. The following excerpts of that decision are instructive for the purpose of this discussion: ""54 Section 19(1)(a)(ii) calls for an assessment of whether an applicant's health would cause or might reasonably be expected to cause excessive demands on Canada's social services. The term 'excessive demands' is inherently evaluative and comparative. Without consideration of an applicant's ability and intention to pay for social services, it is impossible to determine realistically what 'demands' will be made on Ontario's social services. The wording of the provision shows that medical officers must assess likely demands on social services, not mere eligibility for them . [Emphasis added]. ""55 To do so, the medical officers must necessarily take into account both medical and non-medical factors , such as the availability, scarcity or cost of publicly funded services, along with the willingness and ability of the applicant or his or her family to pay for the services.","Determinations of medical inadmissibility based on excessive demands require an individualized assessment of the person's condition, capabilities and actual needs, together with the availability of family support."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [8] In reply, the respondent stated that the applicants did not meet the heavy burden imposed on them to reverse the non-credibility finding. According to the respondent, there were many defects in the evidence, including hesitant, improvised testimony with unusually long silences, serious contradictions, a major omission and many implausibilities, as well as many irregularities in the documents. Moreover, it was reasonable for the Panel not to accept the applicants' explanations, and the Court should not interfere ( REFERENCE). Even if an error had been committed by the Panel, this error would not have been fatal since there were many defects in the claim ( TARGETCASE). Lastly, the applicants do not explain how the delay in the decision caused them irreparable harm, and the Panel explained why there was a delay, namely, the need to obtain independent translations of Exhibit C-23 and to subsequently ask the applicants to comment. ","Even if an error had been committed by the Panel, this error would not have been fatal since there were many defects in the claim."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [36] I agree with the respondent that the CSC is entitled to collect and maintain information about allegations made against inmates and file it as part of their institutional record even if the information is ""totally spurious"" ( <REFERENCE> ), at least until ""a point when information of the sort in issue here will become stale and of little value or relevance in making decisions about security classifications"" ( <TARGETCASE> ). However, contrary to what the respondent submits, the applicant is not submitting that the CSC should not have recorded this incident in his file. Rather, he takes issue with the fact that this information has been used to classify him as a medium security inmate, as a result of which he has been, and risks being again, denied transfer to a lower security institution.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [40] The Applicant's submission that the Board made contradictory findings ignores the strong credibility finding which was determinative. Accepting that the Applicant was detained in 1996 does not mean that his fear of persecution was well-founded given that his evidence was inconsistent, there were unexplained omissions in his PIF and he traveled to and from Sri Lanka without difficulty. Further, noting that LTTE supporters faced some risk was not contradictory because the Board found the Applicant did not fit the profile of being at risk. Further, the fact that he would be subject to a screening process does not create a risk of a well-founded fear of persecution. <REFERENCE> Analysis <TARGETCASE> ",The fact that an individual would be subject to a screening process does not create a risk of a well-founded fear of persecution.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: ""Reasonable grounds to believe"" is the appropriate standard for judges to apply when reviewing a continuation of detention under the certificate provisions of the IRPA . The IRPA therefore does not ask the designated judge to be deferential, but, rather, asks him or her to engage in a searching review. The same approach and logic should be followed for reviews of conditions of release of detention. I do not read the teaching of the Supreme Court of Canada referred to above in REFERENCE and REFERENCEas suggesting a different approach. On the contrary, they both complement each other. The designated judge has to perform the searching review based on an objectively reasonable suspicion anchored on facts showing that harm resulting from the danger is substantial and not merely negligible. This searching review must be completed on the standard of ""reasonable grounds to believe"" as clearly mentioned in REFERENCE . This is the approach followed by Justice Blanchard in all of his reviews of conditions of release pertaining to Mr. Mahjoub (see REFERENCE; REFERENCE; TARGETCASE).",The designated judge has to perform a searching review based on an objectively reasonable suspicion anchored on facts showing that harm resulting from the danger is substantial and not merely negligible.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [17] On the other hand, the majority of the Supreme Court of Canada in TARGETCASE that the category of true questions of jurisdiction is narrow indeed and that no questions of jurisdiction had been identified by the Court since REFERENCE. The position of the Supreme Court in REFERENCE confirmed the limited scope of the exceptions to the presumption of reasonableness that applies when an administrative tribunal is interpreting its home statute. In REFERENCE , the central question at issue was the interpretation of section 120.1 of the Canada Transportation Act, SC 1996, c 10 that involved confidential contracts and the availability of a complaint-based mechanism that is limited to shippers that meet the statutory conditions under subsection 120.1(1) ( REFERENCE). The Supreme Court of Canada considered that this issue did not raise a question of central importance to the legal system, and do not have a precedential value outside of issues arising under this statutory scheme ( REFERENCE). Hence, the Supreme Court considered that the presumption of reasonableness was not rebutted ( REFERENCE). ","The category of true questions of jurisdiction is narrow and no questions of jurisdiction had been identified by the Court since a certain reference, confirming the limited scope of exceptions to the presumption of reasonableness when an administrative tribunal is interpreting its home statute."

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [18] The first one is the Federal Court of Appeal's decision in <REFERENCE> (F.C.A.), at paragraph 4, where Justice Décary expresses himself as follows: <REFERENCE> ""¶ 4 There is no longer any doubt that the Refugee Division, which is a specialized tribunal, has complete jurisdiction to determine the plausibility of testimony: who is in a better position than the Refugee Division to gauge the credibility of an account and to draw the necessary inferences? As long as the inferences drawn by the tribunal are not so unreasonable as to warrant our intervention, its findings are not open to judicial review. In Giron , the Court merely observed that in the area of plausibility, the unreasonableness of a decision may be more palpable, and so more easily identifiable, since the account appears on the face of the record. In our opinion, Giron in no way reduces the burden that rests on an appellant, of showing that the inferences drawn by the Refugee Division could not reasonably have been drawn.

As Justice Phelan highlights, a motion for summary judgment is to determine whether there is a ""genuine issue for trial"", and not to litigate the merits of the trial. After hearing the motion in Socan , Justice Phelan states ""one wonders if the same time, efforts and client expense would have been better spent getting this case ready for trial"" (para. 3).

Indeed, it was reasonably open for the Registrar to find that the Subject Mark has been used by the respondent in the normal course of business. Photographs of a complete box or multiple boxes would have been helpful, but the lack of photographs, is not determinative, as I find that the production of a specimen carton and relevant invoices are conclusive evidence.

Given that this court has not been called upon to review many decisions of the Board, I have decided to reproduce Mr. Justice Dureault's summary in its entirety: ""A brief historical review of the patent legislation affecting medicines will be found relevant to the circumstances under which the impugned provisions were enacted. The Patent Act , S.C. 1923, c. 23, s. 17, allowed for compulsory licenses to be granted for the manufacture, use, and sale of patented processes. Up until 1969, when the 1923 Act was amended (S.C. 1968-69, c. 49) to permit compulsory licenses to import patented pharmaceutical products, few applications for compulsory licenses were made. Subsequent to the 1969 amendment, however, 559 licenses to import and sell have been applied for; of these, 306 have been granted, 15 have been refused or terminated, 96 have been abandoned or withdrawn, and 142 were still pending as of January 31, 1985.","The Patent Act allowed for compulsory licenses to be granted for the manufacture, use, and sale of patented processes, and was later amended to permit compulsory licenses to import patented pharmaceutical products."

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [17] In another recent decision, <REFERENCE> ; 287 F.T.R. 306; 2006 FC 221, the conclusion I reached was that the proper standard of review to be applied to a forfeiture decision was reasonableness. In Khalife , the issue was whether the officer had exercised her discretion properly in deciding to order the forfeiture of 50% of the cash bond. It was not contested in that case that the officer had the discretion not to forfeit the bond or to forfeit a lesser amount. In this matter, the position taken by the respondent is that the officer had no discretion to exercise, once she determined that there had been a breach of a release condition. That is a question of law reviewable on the correctness standard. I remain of the view that, overall, the decision to forfeit a cash bond should withstand scrutiny on the reasonableness standard. <TARGETCASE> Breach of conditions <REFERENCE> ","The officer had no discretion to exercise, once she determined that there had been a breach of a release condition, and the decision to forfeit a cash bond should withstand scrutiny on the reasonableness standard."

The Court stated: <REFERENCE> ... in the present case, the officer did not err by refusing Mr. Johnson's application for permanent residence. The convictions were in force when the negative decision was made and they remained in force until set aside on appeal. Again, I note the consequence of upholding a deportation order on the basis of a conviction giving rise to it was valid at the time that the order was issued [ Smith ] is of much more imminent effect than upholding, on the same basis, a negative decision on an inland application for permanent residence.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [22] The question as posed is clearly relevant. The plaintiff, on this line of questioning, will be able to determine whether or not it should call the customers of the defendant as witnesses in order to establish whether or not a purchase of noninfringing tickets was connected to the purchase of infringing tickets. Since all profits directly or indirectly related to an infringement are recoverable, this question is relevant ( <TARGETCASE> C.P.R.(3d) 116, at p. 119 (F.C.A.), and <REFERENCE> C.P.R.(3d) 15, at p. 20 (T.D.)) The prothonotary was correct in finding that questions which asked ""whether other sales were made because of the sale of infringing tickets"" were irrelevant. The answer to those questions is properly in the minds of the defendant's customers and not in the mind of the defendant. However, question 1310 as posed is quite factual, relevant and will be answered. The appeal, in this regard, is allowed.

The evidence consisted of an incident report stating the applicant was on ""voluntary overtime"", was ""on duty"" and was wearing ""acceptable uniform"" at the time of the accident ( <REFERENCE> at paras. 46-49); therefore, the VRAB made an unreasonable decision because it came to a conclusion that was not supported by the evidence.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [134] That Court went on to consider that more than a possibility that something might work is required. Noel JA wrote at paragraphs 43 to 46: 43 The reasoning advanced by Mr. Justice Laddie and approved by the English Court of Appeal is that where the motivation to achieve a result is very high, the degree of expected success becomes a minor matter. In such circumstances, the skilled person may feel compelled to pursue experimentation even though the chances of success are not particularly high. 44 This is no doubt the case. However, the degree of motivation cannot transform a possible solution into an obvious one. Motivation is relevant in determining whether the skilled person has good reason to pursue ""predictable"" solutions or solutions that provide ""a fair expectation of success"" (see respectively the passages in <TARGETCASE> both of which are referred to with approval <REFERENCE> - <REFERENCE> , at paragraphs 57 and 59).",The degree of motivation cannot transform a possible solution into an obvious one.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: The employer witness did make reference to a slow down in the North Sea operation which may have resulted in a lack of work but there was no evidence whatsoever of a slow down or lack of work in the offshore area in which the Sedco 710 was operating at the time this complaint was made. There is no evidence that other employees on the Sedco 710 were affected in any way by the slow down in the North Sea operation. The only employee who appears to have been affected by a lay-off seems to have been the complainant. The scenario that the employer presents of having five assistant drillers for four positions was essentially the employees own creation. Thus, there was no lack of work per se on the Sedco 710 based on legitimate considerations. To this end, I find that the termination of the complainant based on lack of work was, in fact, a sham. If the respondent were to succeed in these circumstances, the recourse offered employees through Division V.7, Part III of the Canada Labour Code could be reduced to a nullity. < TARGETCASE>","The termination of the complainant based on lack of work was a sham, and if allowed, the recourse offered employees through Division V.7, Part III of the Canada Labour Code could be reduced to a nullity."

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [34] Returning to the principles elucidated by the Supreme Court of Canada <TARGETCASE> (which reduced from two to three standards of review, correctness or reasonableness with the third standard of patently unreasonableness being folded into the reasonableness standard), it is clear at paragraph 53 where the question is one of fact, discretion or policy, deference will usually apply automatically which means the standard of reasonableness. Moreover, at paragraph 54, Justices Bastarache and LeBel stated deference ""will usually result where a tribunal is interpreting its own statute ..."" or where the tribunal had developed particular expertise in the application of a general common law or civil law rule in relation to a specific statutory context, adjudication in labour law being a good example. <REFERENCE> ","When the question is one of fact, discretion or policy, deference will usually apply automatically, meaning the standard of reasonableness applies.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [18] While the court does have jurisdiction to refer a matter back for redetermination in accordance with such directions as it considers appropriate, it seems to me that the court should only issue directions to a tribunal in the nature of a directed verdict, where the case is straightforward and the decision of the court on the judicial review would be dispositive of the matter before the tribunal. While such cases undoubtedly will arise, as a general rule, the court should leave to tribunals, with their expertise in the matters over which they have jurisdiction, the right to make decisions on the merits based on the evidence before them. <TARGETCASE> ",The court should only issue directions to a tribunal in the nature of a directed verdict when the case is straightforward and the decision of the court on the judicial review would be dispositive of the matter before the tribunal.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [32] Finally Ms. Therrien contends the PSIC's decision is unreasonable in that the remedies under the Act differ substantially from the remedies available under the PSLRA. In my view the decisions of the Court in REFERENCE and its companion case of TARGETCASE constitute a complete response. Reasonableness is to be assessed on the subject matter of the complaint and not on the remedy available. In any event, I do not share the contention that the remedies are substantially different.

The discretion of an enforcement officer is very limited under subsection 48(2) of the Act (see Baron above, at paragraph 14), as he or she is required to remove as soon as reasonably practicable. The applicant was under no legitimate expectation from either the officer or the immigration manuals that she would be able to stay in Canada until her PRRA litigation was concluded.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: Her most severe functional impairment appears to be in communication with a noted language delay. Although capable of simple tasks in a controlled environment, she requires and is expected to require some level of assistance and supervision indefinitely. Even with further occupational training, it is reasonable to assume that her occupations at best and that remuneration from her occupation will be inadequate for functional economic self sufficiency. The applicant will likely remain in a dependancy position indefinitely. If landed, she and her family will be entitled to and will likely require a variety of supports. The supports would include supports for intellectual functioning and adaptive skills. In particular, training and support will be needed for communication, home-living, community use skills, self-direction, health and safety issues, functional academics, leisure activities and occupational self-acquisition. The requirement for these support structures will likely create an excessive demand on Canadian social services making this applicant inadmissable under s. 19(1)(a)(ii) of the Immigration Act . < TARGETCASE>","The requirement for support structures for individuals with severe functional impairments may create an excessive demand on Canadian social services, making such individuals inadmissible under s. 19(1)(a)(ii) of the Immigration Act."

Again, while I might have resolved the matter differently, timeliness was a relevant consideration for the Commission in deciding that the arbitration alternative ought not to be exhausted. There is thus no indication of the Commission taking account of irrelevant considerations or failing to take account of relevant ones or bad faith by the Commission and there is therefore no justification for the court to interfere with this exercise of discretion by the Commission. <TARGETCASE> ",Timeliness was a relevant consideration for the Commission in deciding that the arbitration alternative ought not to be exhausted.

On a strict reading of this definition of relevancy, in Rule 222(2) a party, arguably, might not have to produce a document which is relevant in the traditional sense and which supports its own case, but upon which that party does not intend to rely.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [45] The applicants start from a false premise, namely that the Immigration Manual is binding on immigration officers. This argument runs counter to case law holding that the Minister and the Minister's agents are not bound by the Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) guidelines found in that Manual because the guidelines are not regulations and do not have the force of law ( <REFERENCE> ; Canadian <REFERENCE> (F.C.A.)). <TARGETCASE> ",The Minister and the Minister's agents are not bound by the Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) guidelines found in the Immigration Manual because the guidelines are not regulations and do not have the force of law.

In its context, that statement appears to have been based on the quality of proof required in criminal and civil cases. I have been unable to find in the cases to which we were referred on this subject that lack of identity of issue could be founded on such differences.

The Federal Court of Appeal, in <TARGETCASE> , held that this section precludes the granting of judgments in Canada expressed in foreign currency.

The untruth or misleading information may fall short of this and yet have been an inducing factor in admission. Evidence, as was given in the present case, that certain incorrect answers would have had no influence in the admission of a person is, of course, relevant to materiality. But also relevant is whether the untruths or the misleading answers had the effect of foreclosing or averting further inquiries, even if those inquiries might not have turned up any independent ground of deportation .' [Emphasis added.] ""In the case of <REFERENCE> 4], this court applied the <REFERENCE> test, supra, to para. 27(1)(e) of the Act , which is also the relevant paragraph in the case at bar. [This same test was applied by this court in <REFERENCE> ... and in <TARGETCASE> .]","Materiality under s. 19(1)(e)(viii) does not require that the untruth or misleading information in an answer conceals an independent ground of deportation, but it may be an inducing factor in admission and can be relevant if it forecloses or averts further inquiries."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [16] The Notice of Application submitted by the applicant did not plead a challenge to the decision based on an error of law. Rule 301( e ) of the Federal Courts Rules , SOR/98-106, holds that a Notice of Application shall set out ""a complete and concise statement of the grounds intended to be argued, including a reference to any statutory provision or rule to be relied on"". This is mandatory language and as the ground of 'error of law' was not set out in the Notice, the applicant is not permitted to raise it for the first time in his Memorandum ( <REFERENCE> (aff'd 2007 FCA 327); <REFERENCE> ). In <TARGETCASE> , Justice Frederick Gibson set out the justification for such a rule as follows: ","The Notice of Application must include a complete and concise statement of the grounds intended to be argued, and if a ground such as 'error of law' is not set out in the Notice, the applicant is not permitted to raise it for the first time in his Memorandum."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [9] The panel's finding that Mr. Kanendra was inadmissible was based on its determination that Mr. Kanendra was a member of the LTTE, a group which, at the time of his involvement, was engaged in or instigated the subversion of the government of Sri Lanka. This situation is quite similar to that faced by the Federal Court of Appeal in <REFERENCE> (C.A.) (Poshteh). The Applicant <TARGETCASE> , an Iranian citizen, had joined an organization that there were reasonable grounds to believe engages, had engaged, or will engage in terrorism, at the age of 15. His involvement in this group was largely limited to the distribution of pamphlets. Two years later, he was arrested and detained for two weeks because of his involvement with the group. He thereafter fled to Canada and claimed refugee status. ","An individual can be deemed inadmissible if they were a member of a group believed to engage in terrorism, even if their involvement was limited to non-violent activities such as distributing pamphlets."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [19] In my view, TARGETCASE is distinguishable. In REFERENCE , the applicant had testified in two previous refugee proceedings and, on his counsel's advice, did not testify on the third. As a result, a negative inference was drawn. In the present matter, the applicant did not present credible evidence in his previous proceedings that would have aided his H&C application. More importantly, he has not presented any evidence to suggest that a more competent counsel could have resulted in a positive H&C application. I adopt Justice Dawson's reasoning at paragraph 54 of REFERENCE where she held that there is no evidence that would REFERENCE Speculation ","There is no requirement for an applicant to present credible evidence in previous proceedings to aid their H&C application, nor to suggest that more competent counsel could have resulted in a positive H&C application."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [38] Although in the Ikhuiwu case, above, the PRC in question was improperly issued, that the Applicant's PRC in the present matter might have been properly issued is of no distinguishing effect.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [48] Mrs. MacKenzie and her daughter were inquiring about benefits under a benefit-conferring statute. They had every right to presume that those at the Department with whom they dealt had special skills and had every reason to trust those persons to exercise due care.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [8] The starting point for an analysis of the applicant's right to a competent and careful representative is Mr. Justice MacGuigan's decision in <REFERENCE> D.L.R.(4th) 604 (F.C.A.). That case involved a situation where counsel fell asleep repeatedly during the refugee claimant's credible basis hearing. MacGuigan, J.A., refers to an American criminal case which held that sleeping counsel is inherently prejudicial to the defendant when he states at page 611: <TARGETCASE> ""I would be prepared to adopt such a holding, but I would emphasize that in any case where it was applied it would have to be based on a very precise factual foundation ... Given the possibility that a judgment of this kind could found either an action in negligence by the aggrieved client or disciplinary proceedings by the relevant law society, to say nothing of the general loss of reputation on the part of such a sleeping counsel, a court would want to be sure that its conclusion was warranted before so pronouncing. <REFERENCE> Mr. Justice MacGuigan then reviews the evidence in the transcript regarding counsel's actions and found that there was ""enough evidence to establish that there was a problem, but not the exact dimensions of the problem"" and, hence, dismissed the application. <REFERENCE> ","A court may find that sleeping counsel is inherently prejudicial to the defendant, but such a judgment must be based on a very precise factual foundation."

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [27] In <REFERENCE> , above, the Federal Court found it to be an error for the RPD to find that an applicant was not credible because he was not able to provide documentary evidence supporting his claims. The Applicant submits that if the RPD made a negative inference about the Applicant's credibility, it erred in the same manner in the Decision as the decision-maker did in <REFERENCE> . The RPD used an absence of evidence to make a negative credibility finding against the Applicant, and this is a reviewable error ( <REFERENCE> at 8-9; <REFERENCE> [ <TARGETCASE> ] at paragraph 3).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [82] As Mylan does not allege non-infringement with respect to any of the other elements of the claims of the '948 Patent, they must be presumed to be infringed. On the other hand, Lilly bears the burden of proof, on the balance of probabilities, to satisfy the Court that the allegations of non-infringement are not justified: <REFERENCE> [ <REFERENCE> ]; <REFERENCE> .

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [14] In the reasons for <REFERENCE> (T.D.), Justice Pinard held that, while the decision to transfer or refuse an inmate request is discretionary and attracts the duty of procedural fairness, on judicial review it is not for the court to substitute its own opinion for that of the administrative authority. The court cited <REFERENCE> , at 7 <REFERENCE> , to explain the court's approach to the review of discretionary decisions: <TARGETCASE> ""it is ... a clearly-established rule that the courts should not interfere with the exercise of a discretion by a statutory authority merely because the court might have exercised the discretion in a different manner had it been charged with that responsibility. <REFERENCE> <REFERENCE> Analysis <REFERENCE> Standard of Review <REFERENCE> ",The courts should not interfere with the exercise of a discretion by a statutory authority merely because the court might have exercised the discretion in a different manner had it been charged with that responsibility.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [20] According to Mr. Thuraisingam, the Minister's Delegate erred in law in finding that he was a member of a criminal organization, based upon the documents contained in the disclosure package. In support of this contention, Mr. Thuraisingam cites a number of decisions which have held that it is an error for a Minister's delegate to base a danger opinion, in whole or in part, on unproven criminal charges: <TARGETCASE> . In this case, the police have not even laid charges against Mr. Thuraisingam relating to his alleged gang membership. All we have here, he says, are mere allegations.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [10] The question of the existence of an IFA is determinative of the matter. As set out in <TARGETCASE> , above, at paragraph 21, the concept of an IFA is an inherent part of the Convention refugee definition. In order to be considered a Convention refugee, an individual must be a refugee from a country, not from a region of a country. Therefore, where an IFA is found, a claimant is not a refuge or a person in need of protection (see <REFERENCE> ; ","The concept of an Internal Flight Alternative (IFA) is an inherent part of the Convention refugee definition, and a claimant is not a refugee or a person in need of protection where an IFA is found."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [54] Indeed, what authorities there are would seem to point in the opposite direction. Thus, <REFERENCE> (B.) and <REFERENCE> C.P.R.(3d) 161 (T.D.), it was held that the proposed mark, KOLA LOKA, which in Spanish means ""crazy glue"", was not likely to be confused with the opponent's mark, KRAZY GLUE. In the course of her reasons for judgment McGillis, J., said (at p. 171 [C.P.R.]): <TARGETCASE> ""However, I have found as a fact that only a minimal proportion of the Canadian population speaks Spanish as a mother tongue or understands Spanish sufficiently to be capable of making the translation. I therefore conclude, on the basis of the facts established by the evidence, that the average consumer, having a vague or imperfect recollection of the registered trademark KRAZY GLUE, would find no degree of resemblance whatever in the ideas suggested by KOLA LOKA and KRAZY GLUE. Furthermore, I would have reached the same conclusion even if the evidence tendered on appeal had established the existence of Spanish communities in Toronto and Quebec City. The mere fact that ethnic enclaves exist in two urban centres in the country would not be sufficient to displace the well-established average consumer test. Rather, such a fact, if established on the evidence, would constitute only an additional element to be considered in addressing the central question of the likelihood of confusion. <REFERENCE> ","The average consumer, having a vague or imperfect recollection of the registered trademark, would find no degree of resemblance in the ideas suggested by two different marks, even if they translate similarly in a different language."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [22] The parties are in agreement as to the applicable standard of review. As stated by the Supreme Court of Canada in <REFERENCE> [ <REFERENCE> ], a court can seek guidance from the existing case law for determining the appropriate degree of deference for a particular type of question. The first question is one of procedural fairness, which courts have held to be reviewable on a standard of correctness ( <TARGETCASE> ; Canada (Minister of Citizenship and <REFERENCE> at para 43; <REFERENCE> FTR 120).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [3] I have found, first and foremost, that the assessment of the applicant's experience as a dental hygienist, and the visa officer's refusal to award units of assessment under the Experience and Occupational factors, were both improper and unfair in the present case. Furthermore, her finding that the applicant has ""not performed a substantial number of the main duties of this occupation as set out in the National Occupational Classification [(the 'NOC')], including the essential ones"" is perverse and capricious, and constitutes a reviewable error of law. <TARGETCASE> ","The assessment of the applicant's experience and the refusal to award units of assessment under the Experience and Occupational factors were both improper and unfair, and the finding that the applicant has not performed a substantial number of the main duties of the occupation is perverse and capricious, constituting a reviewable error of law."

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [13] With respect to the first issue, whether or not the Officer relied on extrinsic evidence without giving notice to the Applicant is an issue of procedural fairness which implicates the Applicants opportunity to respond. In REFERENCE, Justice John O'Keefe held that this issue is reviewable on the correctness standard.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [48] Furthermore, this provision appears to conflict with the NHQ HULL CONCEM ministerial directive dated January 31, 1986, which also dealt with the de facto illegal residents program and to which my colleague, Cullen, J., made reference in <TARGETCASE> definition, in an illegal position and that their arrival in Canada was with the intention of remaining here permanently, such that they have almost invariably committed breaches of the Immigration Act from the beginning of their stay. This recognition, in my view, prompted Cullen, J., in the Johal case to state, at p. 166: ""The De Facto Illegal Residents Program provides an opportunity for illegals to come forward to make their case and probably to gain permanent residence status. I say probably rather than possibly because Parliament recognized an obvious problem, the growing number of illegals and an intention to do something about it - to grant permanent residence status to the vast majority of illegals. Also, Parliament must have been aware that the people who chose to come forward sincerely believed they qualified under the program and most if not all probably had legal advice before taking this monumental (for them) step. Naturally, if they didn't qualify action of one kind or another could be expected to be taken against them leading to eventual deportation.""

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: Unless the threshold test is met, absences from Canada are irrelevant ... In other words, a two-stage inquiry exists with respect to the residency requirements of paragraph 5(1)(c) of the Act . At the first stage, the threshold determination is made as to whether or not, and when, residence in Canada has been established. If residence has not been established, the matter ends there. If the threshold has been met, the second stage of the inquiry requires a determination of whether or not the particular applicant's residency satisfies the required total days of residence. It is with respect to the second stage of the inquiry, and particularly with regard to whether absences can be deemed residence, that the divergence of opinion in the Federal Court exists.""

question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [27] The standard of review applicable to the IAD's decision is reasonableness ( REFERENCE). The decision to grant special relief falls within the expertise of the IAD and attracts a high degree of deference.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [20] However, these alternatives would involve proceedings separate from the original oppositions. There is a difference of opinion between the parties as to whether remedies outside the context of the existing proceedings can constitute effective remedies as contemplated in TARGETCASE . This difference of opinion apparently exists also in the jurisprudence. REFERENCE clearly concludes in the affirmative. However, the opposite conclusion was reached in REFERENCE .

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [18] In this case, the RPD took into consideration the fact that there were multiple extortion demands that sometimes included death threats. However, it was reasonable to find that these facts were not enough to place the applicants outside the generalized risk of violence and to demonstrate that, on the balance of probabilities, Mr. Gonzalez had been targeted by a gang or likely would be in the future. The applicants did not raise any fact other than those that were noted by the RPD and have not satisfied me of how, or at what point, their risk became personalized. Given the absence of such facts, I can only find that the RPD's finding does not fall ""within the range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of facts and law"" ( <TARGETCASE> ).

While this argument is significant to determine the scope of procedural fairness, it is not, however, entirely true, as the right to the disclosure of an investigation report produced under section 13 of the Regulations has been presumed by the Federal Court in past decisions ( <TARGETCASE> ; 2005 FC 1097), so that there are in fact some precedents.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [31] With respect to the arguments advanced, the submission that the interim measure is unconstitutional because s. 22 of the Act discriminates on the basis of age is countered by the applicants' alternative argument (with which the respondent agrees). Section 22 does not apply to Mr. Worthington. The right allegedly infringed must be that of the person who makes the challenge. Thus, any argument in relation to s. 22 constitutes an attempt to assert the rights of a third party.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [33] The Applicants also argue that it was unreasonable to find that the principal Applicant was not assigned to China on a temporary basis and would not return to work for 2727056 in Canada. The Applicants distinguish TARGETCASE , above, on the basis that it involved an applicant whose position was not designed for movement between China and Canada and required little interaction with her Canadian employer.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [42] A visa officer is under no duty to seek to clarify a deficient application ( <TARGETCASE> , above, at para. 8).

Indeed, the respondent argues that the applicant's argument is predicated on the notion that he was treated adversely as a result of being deaf, but that the evidentiary basis for this argument was not established.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [33] The test to determine whether a trademark with a deviation is substantially different from the registration was set out by Justice Pratte <REFERENCE> Internationale pour l'informatique <REFERENCE> C.P.R.(3d) 523 (F.C.A.), at pages 408-409: <REFERENCE> ""The problem to be resolved is not whether CII deceived the public as to the origin of its goods.

That question must be answered in the negative unless the mark was used in such a way that the mark did not lose its identity and remained recognizable in spite of the differences between the form in which it was registered and the form in which it was used. The practical test to be applied in order to resolve a case of this nature is to compare the trade mark as it is registered with the trade mark as it is used and determine whether the differences between these two marks are so unimportant that an unaware purchaser would be likely to infer that both, in spite of their differences, identify goods having the same origin. <TARGETCASE> ","The test to determine whether a trademark with a deviation is substantially different from the registration is to compare the trademark as it is registered with the trademark as it is used and determine whether the differences are so unimportant that an unaware purchaser would likely infer that both, despite their differences, identify goods having the same origin."

That case involved a situation where counsel fell asleep repeatedly during the refugee claimant's credible basis hearing.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [12] All of the foregoing may seem a little severe when applied to a lay litigant. However I would make several observations. First, Mr. Hughes is running a number of litigation files for his own account at this point, as well as one for his sister-in-law. Further, while Mr. Hughes may be doing the best that he can with his busy schedule and under the circumstances, that is not an excuse and here I would refer to two decisions. <TARGETCASE> (T.D.), Mr. Justice Denault observed, at page 258: ""The absence of counsel to represent the applicant does not in any way relieve the latter from the duty to comply with the Federal Court Rules in order to protect his rights.""

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [50] In light of this, the Respondent reasons that an oral hearing was not required under section 113 of the IRPA because the factors in section 167 of the Regulations are not engaged. Citing TARGETCASE, the Respondent argues that an oral hearing should be held only if the PRRA decision is premised on an applicant's personal credibility , as opposed to a finding that the applicant's evidence is insufficient to establish on a balance of probabilities that the Applicant is a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [14] The applicant submits that the fact that the word ""knowingly"" is absent in subsection 40(1) suggests that having knowledge of misrepresentation should not play a role in finding misrepresentation. On the other hand, she points out that section 127 of the Act states that no person shall knowingly directly or indirectly misrepresent or withhold material facts related to a relevant matter that induces or could induce an error. Contravening section 127 of the Act is an offence. The applicant submits that removing knowledge as a prerequisite of an inadmissibility finding under subsection 40(1) means that the liberty interest of an applicant could be impacted even if they had not intended to commit a misrepresentation.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [12] The Applicant says that the Immigration Officer failed to turn his mind to many of the documents that were submitted to demonstrate his establishment in Canada. The Applicant relies on this Court's decision in REFERENCE: 52 I acknowledge that decision-makers are presumed to have considered all of the evidence before them. Therefore, they are not required to make specific reference to every piece of evidence in the record. Failure to analyse evidence that contradicts a tribunal's decision will be found to be unreasonable only when the evidence that is overlooked is critical, contradicts the tribunal's conclusion and ultimately the reviewing Court finds that the omission indicates the tribunal's unwillingness to consider the materials before it ( REFERENCE).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [45] As to the issue of the evidence, Justice Snider set out some guiding principles in <REFERENCE> : <REFERENCE> [...] <REFERENCE> The Board is presumed to have considered the totality of the evidence, and is not required to refer to every piece of evidence in its decision ( <REFERENCE> [ Cepeda-Gutierrez ]). <REFERENCE> It is a reviewable error for the Board to engage in selective analysis of documentary evidence, accepting evidence that supports its conclusions but ignoring contradictory evidence without explanation (see, for example, <REFERENCE> (TD) (QL)). The relevance of the contradictory evidence to the facts in dispute must be taken into account; the more relevant the evidence, the more likely that failure to mention it will render the decision unreasonable ( Cepeda- <TARGETCASE> at paras 14-17). The Board may demonstrate that it considered a particular document by addressing the substantive point for which the contradictory evidence was put forward, rather than making explicit reference to the document itself. <REFERENCE> ","The Board engaging in selective analysis of documentary evidence, accepting evidence that supports its conclusions but ignoring contradictory evidence without explanation, is a reviewable error, especially if the ignored evidence is highly relevant to the facts in dispute."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [13] I note that <TARGETCASE> , Rothstein, J., considered the documentary evidence there in question to be from sources available to the public and he referred to the decision of Mr. Justice Rouleau in <REFERENCE> (T.D.). In the latter case, where documentary evidence of country conditions considered in a PDRCC assessment is material that is publicly available, Rouleau, J., held there was no obligation to inform the applicant, in advance of a decision, of specific documents concerning country conditions that are being considered. That same principle was applied <REFERENCE> by Rothstein, J., and in my view it is applicable here, at least with reference to documents published and available from public sources prior to the date of any submission by the applicant. <REFERENCE> ","When documentary evidence of country conditions considered in a PDRCC assessment is publicly available, there is no obligation to inform the applicant, in advance of a decision, of specific documents being considered."

This restriction on the availability of an oral hearing flies in the face of Article 3 of the Regulations . Article 3 of the Regulations states that ' in any proceeding under the Act ' [my emphasis], it is at the applicant's choosing whether he or she proceeds by personal appearance and oral submissions. ""... There is no suggestion in the Regulations that oral submissions are granted only after an initial screening for relevancy. Indeed, s. 28(1) of the Veterans Review and Appeal Board Act is to a similar effect and states, 'Subject to subsection (2), an appellant may make a written submission to the appeal panel or may appear before it, in person or by representative and at their own expense, to present evidence and oral arguments'."" <REFERENCE> , supra, at para 40.

I do not have to substitute my judgment for that of the Board and make specific findings of fact on the evidence as a whole.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [16] In <TARGETCASE> , 2003 SCC, the Supreme Court of Canada clearly articulated that a violation of procedural fairness or natural justice is not subject to any standard of review, concluding the following: The content of procedural fairness goes to the manner in which the Minister went about making his decision, whereas the standard of review is applied to the end product of his deliberations. ( ...) On occasion, a measure of confusion may arise in attempting to keep separate these different lines of enquiry. Inevitably some of the same ""factors"" that are looked at in determining the requirements of procedural fairness are also looked at considering the ""standard of review"" of the discretionary decision itself. ( ...) The point is that, while there are some common ""factors"", the object of the court's inquiry in each case is different. [ emphasis added ] 1. Are the affidavits filed after the H&C decision admissible on this application for judicial review? ",A violation of procedural fairness or natural justice is not subject to any standard of review.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [65] It is settled law that when a claimant swears to the truth of his testimony, that testimony is presumed to be true unless there is a valid reason to doubt its truthfulness ( <TARGETCASE> (CA) at para 5). In the absence of any such reasons, in my view, the Applicant met the burden of establishing his sexual identity by way of his sworn affidavit. Accordingly, the Officer unreasonably demanded corroborating evidence of that fact. 3. Did the officer make veiled credibility findings and breach procedural fairness in refusing an oral hearing? ","When a claimant swears to the truth of his testimony, that testimony is presumed to be true unless there is a valid reason to doubt its truthfulness."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [36] In the alternative, the Applicant submits that the Officer's decision was unreasonable.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [32] First, the respondent submitted that it was not proper for the applicants to name the Appeal Board and its members as respondents (see TARGETCASE). The respondent submitted that a judicial review brought under s. 18 of the Federal Court Act is a proceeding to review decisions of federal boards and is normally brought against those who were adverse in interest to the applicants in respect of that decision (see REFERENCE). The respondent submitted that the role of the administrative tribunal whose decision is at issue is limited to explaining the record before the tribunal and to making representations with respect to jurisdiction (see REFERENCE). The respondent submitted that where a federal board is erroneously named as a respondent it will have no status as respondent and will not be allowed to participate in the proceedings until it obtains leave to intervene (see REFERENCE). The respondent pointed out that in the present situation, no such leave has been obtained. The respondent submitted that the court may order that a person who is not a proper or necessary party ceases to be a party, or order that a person who ought to have been joined as a party be joined, pursuant to rule 104 of the Federal Courts Rules .

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [47] The Federal Court of Appeal in TARGETCASE, had another opportunity to consider when deferral of removal may be appropriate. Mr. Shapati asked the enforcement officer to defer his removal pending his application for judicial review of a negative PRRA decision. The refusal to defer was based on the fact that Mr. Shapati had ""produced no evidence of some new (that is, post-PRRA) risk."" From this the Federal Court of Appeal inferred ""that if Mr. Shapati had such evidence, the officer would have considered whether it warranted deferral and exercised his discretion accordingly.""

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [14] However, it appears that even if the CRDD panel had concluded that the call-up notice was genuine (as it appears to be) would the result have been different? Maybe not. The panel, after all, found that the applicant would not have been, and would not be, persecuted in any Convention sense if he were compelled to perform military service. At pp. 6 & 7 of the CRDD's decision, pp. 009 and 010 of the tribunal record (TR) the panel wrote: <TARGETCASE> ""The claimant also raises his fear of return to Romania on account of conscription. The claimant was only sixteen when he left, but turned eighteen on 1 January 1996. The RCO asked the claimant why he did not want to perform military service.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [29] <REFERENCE> ( <TARGETCASE> ) the Supreme Court of Canada recognized that, although the reasonableness simpliciter and patent unreasonableness standards are theoretically different, ""the analytical problems that arise in trying to apply the different standards undercut any conceptual usefulness created by the inherently greater flexibility of having multiple standards of review"": <REFERENCE> at paragraph 44.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [12] The respondent contends, and the Court agrees, that these documents constitute the reasons for the decision under review. <TARGETCASE> at paragraph 44, the Supreme Court of Canada found that the notes of a reviewing officer could be taken to be the reasons for the Minister’s decision. The reasoning in Baker depended in part on the administrative nature of the decision under review. The decision in the case at bar is also administrative.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [29] Although the applicant did not specifically address the issue of the appropriate standard of review, the jurisprudence has consistently held that questions of credibility, just like questions as to whether an applicant has rebutted the presumption of state protection and IFA findings, are questions of mixed fact and law, to be reviewed on a standard of reasonableness ( <TARGETCASE> ).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [66] The applicant also referred to several other cases, including TARGETCASE, which establish that UNHCR status is relevant and must be considered by the Officer or Board. REFERENCE is almost identical to the decision in REFERENCE and reinforces the need to consider the UNHCR status. Justice Snider noted at REFERENCE). This is a central element to the context of the decision. The Officer, faced with a UNHCR refugee, should have explained why her assessment did not concur with that of the UNHCR. She was not under any obligation to blindly follow the UNHCR designation; however, she was obliged to have regard to it. Unless a visa officer explains why a UNHCR designation is not being followed, we have no way of knowing whether regard was had to that highly relevant evidence.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [5] The decision of Mahoney, J.A., in <TARGETCASE> (F.C.A.), dealt with a similar issue. In that case, after hearing the oral testimony of the applicant and before the RHO or counsel had a chance to make oral representations, the presiding member announced that the Board was only concerned with the connection of the persecution feared by the claimant to a Convention refugee ground. The presiding member requested in the interests of time that the representations of counsel and the RHO be made by way of written submissions. Neither the RHO nor the claimant's counsel dealt with the issue of credibility in their submissions which were later sent to the Board. Nevertheless, the negative determination of the Board was made largely on the basis of adverse findings of credibility. Mahoney, J.A., writing for the court, found as follows on p. 2: ""There has been a gross denial of natural justice here. The panel had stipulated that the appellants feared persecution and that the only issue was whether that persecution was encompassed in the Convention definition.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [27] The respondent submits that the RPD did not err in its finding that the applicant failed to rebut the presumption of innocence with clear and convincing evidence. The Board determined that there are many levels of aid available to the applicant that she could pursue.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [37] The present application concerns something very different, namely, an application under paragraphs 11(1)( b ) and (c) of the Act for the production of written returns and documents. The test for the Court on such an application simply requires the Court to be satisfied of two things, namely, that an inquiry is being made under section 10 and that a person is likely to have information that is relevant to the inquiry. In contrast to the situation in Symbol Technologies , there is no requirement in section 11 for the Court to consider whether there is reason to believe, or reasonable grounds to believe, that grounds exist for the making of an order under part VII.1 or Part VIII of the Act (Air Canada , above, at para 20; <TARGETCASE> 61 CPR (3d) 137, at para 8 (Gen Div)). That function was given by Parliament to the Commissioner , pursuant to subparagraph 10(1)( b )(ii) of the Act. This is an important difference from the test that must be satisfied to obtain a search warrant under subparagraph 15(1)( a )(ii) of the Act. Under that provision, it is the Court which must be satisfied by information on oath or solemn affirmation that there are reasonable grounds to believe that grounds exist for the making of an order under Part VII.1 or Part VIII of the Act.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [11] The adjudicator held that by requiring the complainant to sign an annual contract in 1983 despite having offered her a ""permanent"" teaching contract in 1981, the applicant arbitrarily altered the employment relationship ""under the guise of termination of a contract and replacement"". The adjudicator found that a refusal to sign the annual contracts would have invited termination, jeopardized the complainant's career and caused hardship to herself and her family. He added that the inequality of bargaining power in favour of the employer made the employer's unilateral alteration of the employment relationship ""unconscionable"". Relying on the established body of case law relating to unilaterally imposed policy changes, the Adjudicator went on to conclude that (Adjudicator's Decision, at p. 13): <TARGETCASE> ""In my view, whether an employment policy is arbitrarily imposed or an employment relationship is arbitrarily altered under the guise of termination of a contract and replacement, the principles applied should be no different.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [21] In TARGETCASE, the same Justice Lemieux, in dealing with re-acquisition of citizenship, found at paragraph 40 of his Reasons that, while not automatic, easily obtained re-acquisition could preclude a claim for refugee protection: In my view, this application for judicial review must be dismissed. In short, the tribunal was not satisfied the applicants had discharged their onus of showing (on the assumption they had lost their status which the tribunal doubted and was supported by the RIR indicating that status was indefinite unless cancelled for reasons not relevant in this case), such loss could not be repaired by administrative reacquisition albeit perhaps not automatic, but easily obtained without return to China. On the evidence, before the tribunal, such conclusion was open to it. In fact, by using the Williams control test, it imposed a more stringent test than the jurisprudence requires - the jurisprudence only requires an applicant who has let his/her status expire to show good reasons failing to prevent such happening. ",Easily obtained re-acquisition of citizenship could preclude a claim for refugee protection.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [19] Regarding the first point, in my opinion the Minister imposes an excessive burden on the respondents.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [14] The Board noted that there was very little information regarding the assault offence except the sentence that was imposed. However, with respect to the firearm offence, the Board referred to the Federal Court of Appeal's decision in <TARGETCASE> ; 384 N.R. 293; 2008 FCA 404 ( <REFERENCE> ), and considered a number of factors to arrive at the conclusion that Mr. Nava Flores had committed a serious non-political crime in the US. The Board based its conclusion on the following elements: - The sentence provided for the offence of illegal possession of a firearm under the Criminal Code : a maximum of 10 years' imprisonment. - The sentence actually imposed in the US: 24 months' imprisonment and 24 months' probation, which it considered to be fairly harsh. - Aggravating circumstances: the offence was committed by Mr. Nava Flores while he was on probation for a violent crime. Also the Board found that, had the firearm not been removed from his possession, there was a possibility that Mr. Nava Flores might have used it (he had purchased the weapon for protection and had already been ridiculed and threatened). ","A number of factors can be considered to conclude that a person has committed a serious non-political crime, including the sentence provided for the offence, the sentence actually imposed, and any aggravating circumstances."

It was submitted that there was no duty upon a removal officer to conduct risk assessments or consider H&C factors in reaching a decision.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [28] It must be remembered that Parliament is presumed not to have enacted legislation that is devoid of content; thus, the interpretation of section 97 frequently relied on by the Refugee Protection Division cannot be supported: for example, it would not protect individuals from natural disasters, as natural disasters affect everyone; it would not protect individuals from criminal acts, as all are at risk of extortion. Section 97 would thus be reduced, in its application, to the protection of individuals who are victimized by criminal acts in countries where the risk of criminality is not widespread or prevalent. In these cases, state protection, logically, is likely to be available. In consequence, section 97 would be stripped of any content and bereft of meaning, a legislative section in search of meaning. <TARGETCASE> ","Section 97 should not be interpreted as only protecting individuals who are victimized by criminal acts in countries where the risk of criminality is not widespread or prevalent, as this would render the legislation devoid of content and meaning."

In that decision, dealing with a motion to reopen made under the former immigration legislation and former Board Rules, [see footnote 1] Justice Evans, as he then was, stated as follows at page 260: ""I am prepared to assume for present purposes that a motion to reopen a decision is an 'interlocutory matter' because, if granted, it will not be a final disposition of the case. It will simply open the gate to a redetermination of the claim by the Refugee Division in accordance with section 69.1.""

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: A detailed definition of ""judicial comity"" is supplied by the British Columbia Court of Appeal as follows: ""The generally accepted view is that this court is bound to follow a previous decision of the court unless it can be shown that the previous decision was manifestly wrong, or should no longer be followed: for example, (1) the decision failed to consider legislation or binding authorities which would have produced a different result, or (2) the decision, if followed, would result in a severe injustice. The reason generally assigned for this approach is a judicial comity. While doubtless this is a fundamental reason for the approach, I think that an equally fundamental, if not more compelling, reason is the need for certainty in the law, so far as that can be established. Lawyers would be in an intolerable position in advising clients if a division of the court was free to decide an appeal without regard to a previous decision or the principle involved in it"" ( <REFERENCE> ; 103 F.T.R. 1 (F.C.), and Justice Mactavish in <REFERENCE> ; 278 F.T.R. 1 (F.C.).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [24] The Applicant argues that, despite the problems raised regarding attestation, the RPD should not have relied on the findings of the Report as its results were deemed to be ""inconclusive"". This argument is flawed. As stated in <REFERENCE> ""forensic examination of a document that results in an ""inconclusive"" finding (particularly when specific problems with the document are identified) does not establish the authenticity of the document"" [emphasis in original] (at para 12). In this case, the Report clearly established that there were serious problems with the document, and although the results in regard to its authenticity were inconclusive, the document was still "" considered to be altered and therefore [was] fraudulent "" (Document Expertise Report, Certified Tribunal Record [CTR] at p 327).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [42] In the related Supreme Court of Canada case of <TARGETCASE> I think this position is made clear at paragraphs 17-18 and 21: For the reasons given by Binnie J. in the companion decision of <REFERENCE> the Crown's arguments must fail. Unlike in <REFERENCE> , the Federal Court's jurisdiction is not at issue in this appeal. Parrish brought its action in the Federal Court. However, the correct procedure - action or application for judicial review - is at issue. Section 17 of the Federal Courts Act gives the Federal Court concurrent jurisdiction over claims for damages against the Crown. Section 18 of the Federal Courts Act does not derogate from this concurrent jurisdiction. There is nothing in ss. 17 or 18 that requires Parrish to be successful on judicial review before bringing its claim for damages against the Crown. [. . . . .] For the reasons given in <REFERENCE> , the Federal Court should have decided Parrish's claim for damages without requiring it to first be successful on judicial review. ","There is nothing in ss. 17 or 18 that requires Parrish to be successful on judicial review before bringing its claim for damages against the Crown, and the Federal Court should have decided Parrish's claim for damages without requiring it to first be successful on judicial review."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [52] The Respondent relies on <REFERENCE> [ Innocent ], for the premise that the analysis under this provision of the IRPA requires a comparison between the individualized risk faced by the applicant and the prevailing country conditions ( <TARGETCASE> [ <REFERENCE> ]).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [11] Justice Layden-Stevenson's reasoning is apposite in this application. Residency itself must, as a matter of evidence, be established on a balance of probabilities. In this case, the Citizenship Judge found that the evidence was insufficient to establish residency as the evidence was unclear and inconsistent. In particular, the Citizenship Judge noted: <REFERENCE> a. On the applicant's residency questionnaire, he noted that he had been living and working in Dubai, UAE, since March 2008. This was in direct contradiction to what he informed CIC during his citizenship test; <REFERENCE> b. There was a discrepancy as to his address as of March, 2008, and whether it was Windsor, Ontario, or the <REFERENCE> lived with him in the UAE for 18 months; <TARGETCASE> d. There was a discrepancy between the Canadian address shown on the residency questionnaire with the residence shown on the temporary Ontario drivers' licence; and <REFERENCE> e. His temporary Ontario driver's licence was applied for the day before the hearing. <REFERENCE> ",Residency must be established on a balance of probabilities.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [10] I agree with counsel for the Applicant that the RAD erred in adopting a reasonableness standard of review; the RAD has a more robust appellate jurisdiction than the one it applied. Here I am guided by the considered view of Justice Phelan in TARGETCASE, above. Justice Phelan found that the policy rationale for deference by the RAD is not sustainable except in relation to credibility issues (see para 37). He also observed that the RAD owed no deference to the RPD based on relative expertise - both were qualified to assess evidence in refugee cases (see para 49). He concluded by characterizing the RAD's appellate authority in the following terms: ",The RAD should not defer except in relation to credibility issues and both the RAD and RPD are equally qualified to assess evidence in refugee cases.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [8] Ms. Omer submits that she had a legitimate expectation that the pre-May 2013 policy would be followed in relation to her application for permanent residence, although she has not provided any evidence that she was aware of the earlier policy, or that she relied on that policy to her detriment. However, as the Supreme Court observed in <REFERENCE> , an applicant who relies on the doctrine of legitimate expectation does not necessarily have to show that she was aware of a past practice or policy, or that she relied on the past practice or policy to her detriment: see also <TARGETCASE> . ","An applicant who relies on the doctrine of legitimate expectation does not necessarily have to show that she was aware of a past practice or policy, or that she relied on the past practice or policy to her detriment."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [50] Most importantly, Mr. Justice Beetz concluded that the ""rights"" referred to in s. 2(e) of the Bill of Rights included rights that went beyond the fundamental rights usually recognized under the concept of ""natural justice"" or ""procedural fairness"". However, a case must nonetheless involve the determination of a person's "" rights "", and a mere privile ge will not be protected by s. 2(e). <TARGETCASE> ","The 'rights' referred to in s. 2(e) of the Bill of Rights include rights beyond the fundamental rights usually recognized under 'natural justice' or 'procedural fairness', but a case must involve the determination of a person's 'rights', and a mere privilege will not be protected by s. 2(e)."

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [44] In the Tele-Direct decision the Court of Appeal indicated that the issue before it had arisen because of the amendments to the Copyright Act enacted in 1993 as part of the North American Free Trade Agree­ment Implementation Act (S.C. 1993, c. 44, s. 53). [see footnote 7] The court noted that one of the elements required under that Agreement was the protection by copyright of data bases, the court questioned at para­graph 16 whether in fact the amendments had been drafted to effectively accomplish this objective. Interestingly, there is now a Bill before the United States Congress [see footnote 8] to overrule the decision of the United States Supreme court in <TARGETCASE> (Un.S. Sup. Ct.), a decision in that country that had a result similar to Tele-Direct in this. There is debate among both United States and Cana­dian authors as to whether the Feist decision is limited to database type cases or will have wider ramifications. [see footnote 9] Given this context and the express references in Tele-direct to NAFTA and the implementa­tion of that agreement, I am persuaded that the statements in Tele-Direct were not intended to effect a major change in the pre-existing jurisprudence. Facts ","The Feist decision in the United States had a result similar to the Tele-Direct case, and there is debate about whether its implications are limited to database cases or have wider ramifications."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [26] The foregoing may well lead to the conclusion that the RPD's interpretation of sections 96 and 97 of IRPA - as opposed to its application of the legal requirements enshrined in them to a particular set of facts - is reviewable on a correctness standard. Arguably, both sections involve interpretation of Canada's obligations under international treaties (the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment ), which are matters of general law that could be considered to be beyond the unique expertise of the RPD. There is authority to support the proposition that interpretations of provisions in IRPA that flow from or involve Canada's obligations under international treaties are reviewable on a correctness standard. <REFERENCE> at paras 42-50 [ <TARGETCASE> ], the Supreme Court of Canada held that the correctness standard applied to the Board's interpretation of the Convention refugee definition contained in the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees , as implemented by sub-section 2(1) of Immigration Act , RSC, 1985, c I-2, which is now captured by section 96 of IRPA, in part because of the nature of the questions involved and the Board's lack of expertise in respect of them. ","The correctness standard applies to the Board's interpretation of the Convention refugee definition contained in the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, due to the nature of the questions involved and the Board's lack of expertise in respect of them."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [47] In my view the Officer's decision in the present case is incorrect, because although the Officer labelled his analysis ""best interests of the child"" and stated he is ""alive, alert and sensitive regarding the best interests of the child"", the question the Officer clearly posed himself in his analysis under this heading was whether removing the child ""would have a significant negative financial, emotional, social or physical impact on him that would be i) unusual and undeserved or ii) disproportionate"". As Justice James Russell states <TARGETCASE> , at para 67: <REFERENCE> A child's best interests are certainly not determinative of an H&C application and are but one of many factors that ultimately need to be assessed. However, requiring that certain interests not be ""met"" or that a child ""suffer"" a certain amount before this factor will weigh in favour of relief, let alone be persuasive in the decision, contradicts well-established principle that officers must be especially alert, alive and sensitive to the impact of the decision from the child's perspective . Furthermore, this would seem to contradict the instruction of the Supreme Court of Canada that this factor be a primary consideration in an H&C application that must not be minimized. [Emphasis added] <REFERENCE> ",A child's best interests are not determinative of an H&C application and are one of many factors to be assessed. Requiring that certain interests not be met or that a child suffer a certain amount before this factor will weigh in favour of relief contradicts the principle that officers must be especially alert to the impact of the decision from the child's perspective.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: Any day during which an applicant for citizenship resided with the applicant's spouse who at the time was a Canadian citizen and was employed outside of Canada in or with the Canadian armed forces or the federal public administration or the public service of a province, otherwise than as a locally engaged person, shall be treated as equivalent to one day of residence in Canada for the purposes of paragraph (1)(c) and subsection 11(1). < REFERENCE> Idem <REFERENCE> (2) The Minister shall grant citizenship to any person who <TARGETCASE> (a) is a permanent resident within the meaning of subsection 2(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, and is the minor child of a citizen if an application for citizenship is made to the Minister by a person authorized by regulation to make the application on behalf of the minor child; or <REFERENCE> (b) was born outside Canada, before February 15, 1977, of a mother who was a citizen at the time of his birth, and was not entitled, immediately before February 15, 1977, to become a citizen under subparagraph 5(1)(b)(i) of the former Act, if, before February 15, 1979, or within such extended period as the Minister may authorize, an application for citizenship is made to the Minister by a person authorized by regulation to make the application.","The Minister shall grant citizenship to any person who is a permanent resident and is the minor child of a citizen if an application for citizenship is made on behalf of the minor child; or was born outside Canada, before February 15, 1977, of a mother who was a citizen at the time of his birth, if an application for citizenship is made."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [40] My colleague Justice Phelan would have preferred in <TARGETCASE> , above, to apply the standard of reasonableness to questions of credibility (paragraph 37). With respect, I am still concerned with the blurring of lines. It seems to be preferable to focus on the standard of palpable and overriding error in appeals on questions of fact. There is nothing new in proposing that an appeal tribunal show deference when a body whose decision is being appealed flows from considerable discretion such as assessing credibility. The law is clear: the RAD does not hear witnesses except in very exceptional and specific cases. The credibility to be given to the witnesses heard by the RPD is its responsibility and the RAD, on appeal, must show deference ( <REFERENCE> ; R v Burke , ","The standard of palpable and overriding error should be applied to appeals on questions of fact, and an appeal tribunal should show deference when the decision being appealed involves assessing credibility."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [868] As was noted earlier, in <TARGETCASE> , the Supreme Court rejected a context-dependent approach to the identification of analogous grounds. It held that ""[o]nce identified, an analogous ground stands as 'a constant marker of potential legislative discrimination' and need not be established again in subsequent cases"": above at para. 2, citing <REFERENCE> , above at paras. 7-10. ","Once identified, an analogous ground stands as 'a constant marker of potential legislative discrimination' and need not be established again in subsequent cases."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [31] Justice Mosley then turns his attention to the decision of the minister's delegate to refer the report to an admissibility hearing. He relies on the Federal Court of Appeal decision in <REFERENCE> to find that the scope of the minister's delegate's discretion depends on whether the person in question is a foreign national or a permanent resident. If the person in question is a foreign national, then the minister's delegate has no discretion to refer the report for an admissibility hearing. If the person in question is a permanent resident, then ""the question was left open whether some minimal amount of discretion was available."" See Richter FC at paragraph 14. In Ms. Richter's case, Justice Mosley finds that the minister's delegate did consider H&C factors and that the decision to refer to an admissibility hearing was reasonable. I conclude from this that Justice Mosley accepts that minister's delegate can exercise ""minimal discretion"" and consider H&C factors without rendering unreasonable the decision to refer the report for an admissibility hearing. <TARGETCASE> ","The minister's delegate's discretion to refer a report for an admissibility hearing depends on whether the person in question is a foreign national or a permanent resident, and they can exercise minimal discretion and consider H&C factors without rendering the decision to refer unreasonable."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: of a decision by a visa officer to refuse to issue a visa to a person on the grounds that the person is a person described in any of paragraphs 19(1)(c.1) to (g), (k) and (l), <REFERENCE> (a) the Minister may make an application to the Federal Court ̵ Trial Division, in camera, and in the absence of the person and any counsel representing the person, for the non-disclosure to the person of information obtained in confidence from the government or an institution of a foreign state or from an international organization of states or an institution thereof; <REFERENCE> (b) the Court shall, in camera, and in the absence of the person and any counsel representing the person, <REFERENCE> (i) examine the information, and <TARGETCASE> (ii) provide counsel representing the Minister with a reasonable opportunity to be heard as to whether the information should not be disclosed to the person on the grounds that the disclosure would be injurious to national security or to the safety of persons; <REFERENCE> (c) the information shall be returned to counsel representing the Minister and shall not be considered by the Court in making its determination on the judicial review if, in the opinion of the Court, the disclosure of the information to the person would not be injurious to national security or to the safety of persons; and <REFERENCE> (d) if the Court determines that the information should not be disclosed to the person on the grounds that the disclosure would be injurious",Counsel representing the Minister should be given a reasonable opportunity to argue against the disclosure of information if it could harm national security or the safety of persons.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [71] It does not, however, follow from this that an officer can never consider additional information provided by an applicant after the initial H&C decision has been made. Rather, these cases simply stand for the proposition that there is no obligation on an immigration officer assessing an H&C application to go back to an applicant in an effort to ferret out additional information supporting the application, when that information has not been provided by the applicant him- or herself. <TARGETCASE> ","There is no obligation on an immigration officer assessing an H&C application to go back to an applicant in an effort to ferret out additional information supporting the application, when that information has not been provided by the applicant him- or herself."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [62] In support of her contention that the reasons provided by the second officer are not adequate, Ms. Alexander relies upon paragraphs 21 and 22 of the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in <TARGETCASE> (F.C.A.). There, Mr. Justice Sexton wrote as follows for the Court: ""21 The duty to give reasons is only fulfilled if the reasons provided are adequate. What constitutes adequate reasons is a matter to be determined in light of the particular circumstances of each case. However, as a general rule, adequate reasons are those that serve the functions for which the duty to provide them was imposed. In the words of my learned colleague Evans, J.A., '[a]ny attempt to formulate a standard of adequacy that must be met before a tribunal can be said to have discharged its duty to give reasons must ultimately reflect the purposes served by a duty to give reasons.' [See Note 7 below] ""22 The obligation to provide adequate reasons is not satisfied by merely reciting the submissions and evidence of the parties and stating a conclusion. [See Note 8 below] Rather, the decision maker must set out its findings of fact and the principal evidence upon which those findings were based. [See Note 9 below] The reasons must address the major points in issue. The reasoning process followed by the decision maker must be set out [See Note 10 below] and must reflect consideration of the main relevant factors. [See Note 11 below].""

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [44] In this case, the Court agrees with the RAD that the wording of subsection 110(4) is very similar to that governing the admissibility of fresh evidence in the context of a PRRA at paragraph 113( a ): <TARGETCASE> 110 (4) On appeal, the person who is the subject of the appeal may present only evidence that arose after the rejection of their claim or that was not reasonably available, or that the person could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented, at the time of the rejection <REFERENCE> ... <REFERENCE> 113.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [32] As for the report aired on the CTV network, it is so obvious that it constituted evidence that the applicant could have easily found on the Internet-particularly given that he is the primary person involved-that he is deemed to have been aware of it (see <TARGETCASE> ","The applicant is deemed to have been aware of evidence that he could have easily found on the Internet, particularly if he is the primary person involved."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [11] The problem is primarily one of statutory interpretation and the task to be addressed is that of ascertaining the intention of Parliament from the words of the statute read in their grammatical and ordinary sense in reference to their context and the other parts of the Act in terms of its scheme and the object and intention of Parliament so far as the latter can be collected from the words of the statute: see Driedger, Construction of Statutes (2nd Ed.), at p. 87; <REFERENCE> D.T.C. 6305; and <TARGETCASE> , per Pratte, J., at p. 872: ""One of the most important rules to be followed in the interpretation of a particular provision of a statute was expressed as follows by Lord Herschell in <REFERENCE> bound when construing the terms of any provision found in a statute to consider any other parts of the Act which throw light upon the intention of the legislature which may serve to shew that the particular provision ought not to be construed as it would be if considered alone and apart from the rest of the Act.'

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [11] The issue that the Applicants have raised regarding the Board's failure to consider written submissions that they sent shortly after the Board's hearing is a question of whether the Board reached its decision without regard to the material before it, as contemplated by paragraph 18.1(4)(d) of the Federal Courts Act , RSC 1985, c F-7. This is reviewable on a standard of reasonableness ( Canada (Minister of Citizenship and <TARGETCASE> , at para 46). To the extent that the Applicants have also suggested that their written submissions were not even forwarded to the Presiding Member of the Board who considered their applications, this would be a question of procedural fairness that is reviewable on a standard of correctness ( <REFERENCE> , above, at paras 55, and 79; <REFERENCE> , above, at para 43). IV. Analysis A. Did the Board err in concluding that the risks alleged by Mr. Baires Sanchez are risks faced generally by other individuals in or from El Salvador?

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [54] I have reviewed the transcript of the hearing and I cannot determine that the Board member gave consideration to all of the factors listed above. Further, there are no written reasons or notes to show how the Board member came to a decision to deny the adjournment. The only factors considered by the Board were that the hearing date was set on a peremptory basis and the conduct of counsel. The Board did not consider the other factors. Based on the facts of this case, this was an error on the part of the Board. I am of the view that this error constituted a breach of the duty of procedural fairness owed to the applicant (see <TARGETCASE> ). ",The error of not considering all factors in a hearing constituted a breach of the duty of procedural fairness owed to the applicant.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [38] Moreover, as the Court observed in <TARGETCASE> , the literature supports this less technical view: see, for example, Waldman, Immigration Law and Practice (Second Ed.), at paras. 11:20 to 11:29. (ii) Functus Officio Does Not Apply to Decisions of Immigration Officers ",The literature supports a less technical view of immigration law and practice.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [8] The analysis, however, does not end there. The respondent submits that the failure of the Board to designate is not fatal and that the Court should only interfere with the decision if the lack of a representative ""could have affected the outcome"" of the case. In support of its position, the respondent refers to the decision of Justice Dawson in <TARGETCASE> (F.C.), where she held at paragraph 10: ""I agree that it is necessary to consider the facts of each particular case and that it may be possible that the failure to designate a representative will not vitiate the determination of a claim."" The jurisprudence on this matter is well-established. The Federal Court of Appeal per Sharlow, J.A., in <REFERENCE> ; 289 N.R. 165 (F.C.A.), held at paragraph 6: ""It is our view that subsection 69(4) of the Immigration Act imposes on the Board an obligation to designate a representative for any refugee claimant who meets the statutory criteria, and that the obligation arises at the earliest point at which the Board becomes aware of those facts.",It may be possible that the failure to designate a representative will not vitiate the determination of a claim.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [30] I note that the Board understood the applicant to fear being ""a target of violence, kidnapping and rape, given the current situation for all women <REFERENCE> "" and made the following two findings.

From that case the proposition is that the plaintiff, having failed to exhaust a grievance procedure and the possible resulting judicial review might not, in substitution, seek a review by way of an action for damages in tort, relying upon <TARGETCASE> (T.D.

With that view, however, I cannot agree. I think that the law is well settled to the contrary, and I need only refer for this purpose to the cases cited by Mr. Hellmuth, viz.: <TARGETCASE> ; 31 O.R. 18 (Div. Ct.) ( Toronto Auer Light ). In that case, the Court was also dealing with a patent on a method for making incandescent devices (illuminant appliance). It is relevant here to review what passages of Von Heyden Justice Boyd, speaking for the Court, found to be of particular interest: "" <REFERENCE> includes a monopoly of the sale ... of products made according to the patented process ...

In this regard, she submits that the term has been broadly interpreted, and that, in the context of law enforcement work where employees are faced with the risk of unpredictable violence, the ""low frequency, high risk principle"" must be applied to the assessment of whether a danger exists. She relies upon the statement in the rehearing of <TARGETCASE> CAO-07-015 [ Martin II ]) that ""where the consequences of a particular event are dire or critical for an individual, prevention measures must be taken to prevent that dire outcome, regardless of the likelihood of that event occurring"" ( Martin II at para 849). In oral argument, counsel for the applicant expanded on this point and submitted that if an employee establishes that there is even a faint possibility of critical injury and the employer has failed to take all reasonable steps to shield the employee from that injury, then a ""danger"" exists within the meaning of Part II of the Code.","Where the consequences of a particular event are dire or critical for an individual, prevention measures must be taken to prevent that dire outcome, regardless of the likelihood of that event occurring."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [25] The Respondent submits that the Board did not make a negative credibility finding on the basis that the Principal Applicant amended her PIFs, but rather that she failed to include important information. PIFs require the inclusion of significant events or reasons which lead to claim protection ( <TARGETCASE> (QL) (TD)). Where amendments are made to a PIF which omit highly relevant and central elements, these can be sufficient to support a negative credibility finding ( <REFERENCE> [ <REFERENCE> ]; <REFERENCE> (QL) (TD)). ","Where amendments are made to a Personal Information Form which omit highly relevant and central elements, these can be sufficient to support a negative credibility finding."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: Apart from this office, the applicant represented his country before the European Union and Mahgreb countries. He testified that he had knowledge of the crimes in which his government was engaged. The applicant who, because of his position in Paris, represented the party in power as well as the Djiboutian government, never tried to disengage himself from these crimes. The evidence indicates that since his recruitment by the MFAIC of Djibouti in 1988, the applicant has always demonstrated his ongoing, active and confident support to the regime. Under the circumstances, therefore, it is my opinion that the IRB assessed the situation reasonably well and that it correctly applied the exclusion clause against the applicant. Despite the skilful arguments of Mr. Bertrand, counsel for the applicants, the panel's finding regarding the applicant's exclusion must also be upheld."" (See also: <TARGETCASE> ; 287 F.T.R. 1; 2006 FC 139, concerning the leader of a political party forming the government in power in Bangladesh).","The IRB assessed the situation reasonably well and correctly applied the exclusion clause against the applicant, and the panel's finding regarding the applicant's exclusion must be upheld."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [12] In TARGETCASE , the refusal of a visa officer to waive the medical examination of the applicant's dependent son with respect to her application for permanent residence in Canada was deemed reasonable. The Applicant distinguished REFERENCE by arguing that Ms. Nguyen had joint custody with her husband ( REFERENCE) whereas in the case at bar, there is no custody agreement or order, and it is Mr. Anderson's uncontroverted, sworn testimony that sole custody has always rested with Onique's mother. In fact, the Applicant attempted to have the child examined abroad, but those efforts were rebuffed by the child's mother. Furthermore, unlike the circumstances in REFERENCE , the Applicant argued that he had no intention to bring Onique to Canada at a future date. Thus, the policy imperatives underlying the medical examination are obviated. ",The refusal of a visa officer to waive the medical examination of the applicant's dependent son with respect to her application for permanent residence in Canada was deemed reasonable.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [25] <TARGETCASE> ( Sierra Club ), the Supreme Court set out the framework and the test to be applied by a court hearing a motion for confidentiality. Thus, before making an order of confidentiality, the Court must be satisfied that the need for preserving the confidentiality of a document outweighs the public interest in open and accessible Court proceedings. The Court reiterated and adapted to the context of the case before it the two-branch test it had previously set out in other decisions ( <REFERENCE> ","Before making an order of confidentiality, the Court must be satisfied that the need for preserving the confidentiality of a document outweighs the public interest in open and accessible Court proceedings."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [4] Section 27 of the Act ""imposes an onerous disclosure obligation on <REFERENCE> . Disclosure obligations ""guarantee fairness in the process leading up to a transfer decision"" by ensuring that ""the individual must know the case that he or she has to meet"": <REFERENCE> at para 82; May at para 92. In the context of security reclassifications and involuntary transfers, disclosure must be sufficient to permit ""the prisoner to participate in a significant manner"" in opposing the transfer, and ""sufficient to permit him to test whether the transfer is founded upon a reasonable and serious concern"": <REFERENCE> citing <REFERENCE> : <REFERENCE> at para 83; <TARGETCASE> . Instead, the requirements of procedural fairness are to be assessed contextually: <REFERENCE> at para 83. That is, although the key issue in this case - whether the disclosure obligations to the applicant were met - will necessarily engage definition of the scope of the applicant's procedural fairness entitlements, the core of the analysis in this particular case is evidentiary and involves an assessment of the specific factual context in which the impugned decision was taken. II.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [254] Secondly, unlike the situation here, there was a clear statutory foundation for the extension of extraterritorial jurisdiction in <TARGETCASE> Spandau prison, which was located within the British zone in West Berlin. The available extract of the decision of the European Commission on Human Rights is very brief, and contains little discussion of the jurisdictional issue, beyond the statement that ""there is, in principle, from a legal point of view, no reason why acts of the British authorities in Berlin should not entail the liability of the United Kingdom under the Convention"".

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [21] The case law of this Court is not yet settled regarding the standard of review that it should apply to the RAD's determination of which standard or review it will apply when reviewing an RPD decision. Some judges have held that the RAD's decision should be reviewed on the correctness standard (see, for example, TARGETCASE), while others have stated instead that the Court was interpreting the RAD's jurisdiction under its home statute and consequently should apply the standard of reasonableness in reviewing the RAD's decision (see, for example, REFERENCE). ",Some judges have held that the RAD's decision should be reviewed on the correctness standard.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [61] What has taken place after the application for mandamus was filed is not relevant to this application. The respondent argued that Rule 302 of the Federal Courts Rules prevents a consideration of any further decision. I agree. At the same time, had citizenship been granted when it should have been, whatever travel done by the applicant would have been of no moment given that the Constitution guarantees the right to enter and leave Canada (subsection 6(1) of the Charter). I note that an inadmissibility report, pursuant to section 44 of the IRPA, can only be made about ""a permanent resident or a foreign national who is in Canada"". It cannot be made about a citizen of this country. <TARGETCASE> Conclusion <REFERENCE> ","An inadmissibility report, pursuant to section 44 of the IRPA, can only be made about a permanent resident or a foreign national who is in Canada and not about a citizen of this country."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [17] The Court notes the case of <TARGETCASE> , where Justice Yvon Pinard held, after citing earlier cases, the fact that an applicant does not request further reasons bars him or her from claiming on judicial review that the reasons provided were inadequate ( Gaoat at para. 13). <REFERENCE> ",An applicant who does not request further reasons is barred from claiming on judicial review that the reasons provided were inadequate.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [23] The Applicant submits that the Board erred in its assumption that the decision of the Board would be persuasive evidence to the Sri Lankan authorities that he is not LTTE. In this argument, the Applicant fails to appreciate the entire context in which reference is made to the Canadian decision. The Board's suggestion that the Applicant show his Board decision to the Sri Lankan authorities is not unreasonable in the context of the decision as a whole. As assumed by the Board and by the Applicant, the Sri Lankan authorities would know that the Applicant travelled to Canada on the M/V Sun Sea , and would logically conclude that he applied for refugee protection. Therefore, theoretically speaking, the Board decision could not place him at greater risk and could be helpful in demonstrating why the Canadian authorities believed that the Applicant is not a member of the LTTE. Although there is no evidence that the Board decision would necessarily be probative to the Sri Lankan authorities, the Board acknowledges that the Sri Lankan government will conduct its own independent evaluation and this is phrased merely as an option. <TARGETCASE> ","Showing the Board decision to the Sri Lankan authorities is not unreasonable as it could be helpful in demonstrating why the Canadian authorities believed that the Applicant is not a member of the LTTE, despite no evidence that the Board decision would necessarily be probative to the Sri Lankan authorities."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: 'I would also draw attention to the two-step analysis proposed by Professor Côté in The Interpretation of Legislation in Canada (3rd Ed. 2000), at p. 324, for resolving discordances resulting from divergences between the two versions of a statute: 'Unless otherwise provided, differences between two official versions of the same enactment are reconciled by educing the meaning common to both. Should this prove to be impossible, or if the common meaning seems incompatible with the intention of the legislature as indicated by the ordinary rules of interpretation, the meaning arrived at by the ordinary rules should be retained.' ""27. There is, therefore, a specific procedure to be followed when interpreting bilingual statutes. The first step is to determine whether there is discordance. If the two versions are irreconcilable, we must rely on other principles: see Côté, supra, at p. 327. A purposive and contextual approach is favoured: see, for example, <REFERENCE> , at para. 26; <REFERENCE> at para. 27; <REFERENCE> at para. 33. ""28. We must determine whether there is an ambiguity, that is, whether one or both versions of the statute are 'reasonably capable of more than one meaning': Bell <TARGETCASE> , at para.","When interpreting bilingual statutes, if the two versions are irreconcilable, a purposive and contextual approach is favoured, and it must be determined whether one or both versions of the statute are 'reasonably capable of more than one meaning'."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [23] For the most part, the applicant's submissions concerned the fact that she had obtained a conditional discharge, thus ruling out paragraph II.35(2)(a) of the Program. When a discharge is granted, this creates a legal fiction, and the person convicted is deemed to have never been convicted ( <TARGETCASE> ( per Mr. Justice Marc Beauregard of the Quebec Court of Appeal)). Therefore, she submits that the respondent cannot render his decision on the basis of the above-mentioned paragraph, which states that when the Advisory Body makes its recommendation, it is entitled to consider if the person has been convicted of an offence. ","When a discharge is granted, the person convicted is deemed to have never been convicted."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [28] On the other hand, it has been held that deportation for serious offences is not a deprivation of ""liberty"" under s. 7 of the Charter nor is it a ""punishment"" contemplated by s. 12 of the Charter . It has also been held that a deportation order resulting from the perpetration of a serious offence does not contravene s. 7 of the Charter and also that the elimination of the right of appeal to the Appeal Division against a deportation order, as applied to a non-refugee to be in the country who has no legal right to be in the country, does not involve a deprivation of ""liberty"" ( <TARGETCASE> ; 252 F.T.R. 257 (F.C.)). ","Deportation for serious offences is not a deprivation of 'liberty' under s. 7 of the Charter nor a 'punishment' under s. 12 of the Charter, and the elimination of the right of appeal against a deportation order for a non-refugee does not involve a deprivation of 'liberty'."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [21] Furthermore, contrary to the applicants' allegations, the Board did not ignore the evidence before it. It specifically addressed the police and medical reports, the applicants' testimony and the documentary evidence (compare with <REFERENCE> ). Thereby, the Board did not fail to consider the evidence before it, having no obligation to mention every piece of evidence, but rather considered the totality of the evidence and justified its finding of a lack of credibility in ""clear and unmistakable terms"" ( <REFERENCE> (F.C.A.) (QL), 130 N.R. 236; <REFERENCE> , above at para 19; <TARGETCASE> ). A general finding of a lack of credibility on the part of the applicant may extend to all evidence emanating from his testimony ( <REFERENCE> , above at para 8). Thus, the Board's finding that the applicants were not credible amounted to a finding of a lack of credible evidence on which to base their refugee claim ( <REFERENCE> (T.D.) (QL) at para 6). This finding, further to my above disposition of the natural justice issue, is sufficient to dispose of the present application for judicial review without the necessity of dealing with any other issues raised by the applicants.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [42] Hoffmann-La Roche concedes the authority of these cases but suggests that the situation should be different when a person loses a property right, in part, because of a government agency's error. This would be true, perhaps, if there were room for discretion or compromise in the language of the governing statute. However, I cannot see any room for relief in the case before me. The statute is clear. If I were to extend the time for paying the maintenance fee in this case, I would be substituting my own deadline for that enacted by Parliament. As Lord Parmoor stated in the Canadian Northern Railway case, above, ""if the power given to the Court to relieve against penalties applied to statutory penalties, this would, in effect be giving an authority to enable the Court to repeal statutes"" ( <REFERENCE> (P.C.), at p. 725).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [11] It is common ground between the parties that the issues in this application are all reviewable on a standard of reasonableness (REFERENCE; REFERENCE). In brief, the decision under review will stand unless it is not within the ""range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law"" ( REFERENCE). In this regard, ""as long as the process and the outcome fit comfortably with the principles of justification, transparency and intelligibility, it is not open to a reviewing court to substitute its own view of a preferable outcome"" (TARGETCASE). Given the highly discretionary nature of decisions made under section 25 of the IRPA, immigration officers ordinarily will have a broad range of acceptable and defensible outcomes available to them (REFERENCE).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [18] As noted by counsel for the defendant, the Federal Court has already considered the matter in <TARGETCASE> the court striking out the statement of claim of the assignee of film distribution rights.

It was alleged before the court by the plaintiffs that they held copyright in a film production of the rock group called 'Queen'. It is evident to me pursuant to the agreement of November 24, 1981, between one of the defendants and Mobile Vision-Q Productions Inc., that any copyright or rights derived therefrom were owned by the defendant Rushing Water Productions Limited; that the plaintiffs herein, if at all, were granted no more than an ancillary right or a collateral interest under the Copyright Act, R.S.C. 1970, c.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [42] When it comes to state protection, there exists a presumption that, apart from situations of total breakdown, a state is capable of protecting its citizens. In order to rebut this presumption, the Applicant must present clear and convincing evidence that the protection is inadequate (see <TARGETCASE> , 20 Imm LR (2d) 85, at para 57). If the tribunal finds the country in question to be democratic, the Applicant will bear an even heavier burden of proof. Indeed, as stated by the Federal Court of Appeal: ""The more democratic the state's institutions, the more the claimant must have done to exhaust all the courses of action open to him or her [meaning the Applicant]"" ( <REFERENCE> , at para 5). In the present matter, based on the evidence submitted, the RPD found that Hungary is a functioning democracy and that there is no evidence of a total breakdown of the state apparatus. Furthermore, it found that Hungary is in effective control of its territory and that it is making serious efforts to protect the Roma, thus rendering the protection offered adequate (see <REFERENCE> CarswellNat 1338).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [12] In Cardin , Justice Mactavish found that Mr. Cardin's application for citizenship was rejected on the Citizenship Judge's specific finding that his absences from Canada meant that he had not sufficiently ""Canadianized"" himself ( Cardin , above at para 13). On reviewing the facts before the Citizenship Judge, Justice Mactavish found that the underlying rationale for applying the Re Pourghasemi test was absent; that is, the facts did not support a conclusion that Mr. Cardin had not become ""Canadianized"". Justice Mactavish's decision was not, as submitted by the Applicant, founded on an obligation of the Citizenship Judge to provide a rationale for rejecting the Re Koo test. In the case before me, the Citizenship Judge did not base her decision on a finding that the Applicant had not become ""Canadianized"".

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [4] The applicant's evidence was that as a result of his arrest and detention, his name was placed on a ""black file"" which prevented him from getting employment or going back to school to upgrade his qualifications. The ""black file"" or ""black marks"" are referred to in the documentary evidence prepared by the Immigration and Refugee Board Documentation Centre in Ottawa, dated December 1991, entitled China: Country Profile . This evidence is consistent with the applicant's story. At page 33 of this document, it is stated: <REFERENCE> ""Every citizen in the People's Republic of China has a personal dossier kept by the local Public Security Bureau (PSB). Although relatively little is known about the personal dossier, in part because citizens are not allowed access to it, there are reports that the dossier contains school records and work unit reports as well as a wide range of personal information, including copies or summaries of all self-criticisms written throughout one's lifetime. Confessions and self-criticisms, long an important aspect of the Chinese legal system, have been required from a wide range of Chinese people since the military crackdown. The information reportedly remains in the file for life, whether specific information is used against an individual immediately, or sometime in the future when political winds have shifted. Currently, many of the dissidents arrested and subsequently released after June, 1989, have had difficulties retaining their old jobs or finding new employment, outside of part-time work, because of 'black marks' on their dossier. <TARGETCASE> ","Every citizen in the People's Republic of China has a personal dossier kept by the local Public Security Bureau (PSB) which contains a wide range of personal information, including 'black marks' that can prevent them from getting employment or going back to school."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [34] In my view, the scheme of IRPA , the object of the Act and the intention of Parliament require the RAD to undergo more than a review for reasonableness when assessing the factual findings of the RPD (for instance, see the principle of statutory interpretation explained in <TARGETCASE> ). This does not necessarily mean that the RAD must conduct its appeal de novo .

Accordingly, a court reviewing a conclusion on the reasonableness standard must look to see whether any reasons support it. The defect, if there is one, could presumably be in the evidentiary foundation itself or in the logical process by which conclusions are sought to be drawn from it. An example of the former kind of defect would be an assumption that had no basis in the evidence, or that was contrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence. An example of the latter kind of defect would be a contradiction in the premises or an invalid inference. <REFERENCE> ","An unreasonable decision is one that is not supported by any reasons that can stand up to a somewhat probing examination, and could be due to a defect in the evidentiary foundation or in the logical process by which conclusions are drawn."

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [17] The citizenship judge did not indicate the method and the tests he used to determine that the respondent had met his residence requirement. The onus that was on the judge to provide adequate reasons for his decision and explain why he found that the respondent had met his residence requirement was even greater because the evidence submitted by the respondent contained significant omissions and contradictions. However, he made no reference to the contradictions or omissions raised by the applicant, or to the content of the questionnaire or the citizenship application, which raises doubt as to whether he considered all of the relevant factors in his analysis. <TARGETCASE> ","The citizenship judge is required to provide adequate reasons for his decision and explain why he found that the respondent had met his residence requirement, especially in cases where the evidence submitted contains significant omissions and contradictions."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [79] Thus, both Justice Stratas in <TARGETCASE> and Justice Noël in <REFERENCE> found that the presumption of reasonableness applies to ministerial decisions or to decisions made by their delegates. Both, however, went on to note that the presumption may be rebutted by analyzing the four factors discussed in <REFERENCE> : (1) the presence or absence of a privative clause; (2) the purpose of the tribunal as determined by interpretation of enabling legislation; (3) the nature of the question at issue; and (4) the expertise of the tribunal.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [8] Before examining the second issue, it is useful to note that, because the question is whether the RPD failed in its duty to abide by the rules of natural justice and procedural fairness, this is not a case in which we should apply the pragmatic and functional method to determine what standard of review is applicable <TARGETCASE> ; 332 N.R. 113 at para. 16 (F.C.A.)).

The traditional exceptions to the hearsay rule remain presumptively in place: TARGETCASE, at para 15.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [26] In the present case, the Applicant argued that there exists contradictory jurisprudence on the issue of whether the age difference is a relevant factor in determining whether the marriage is genuine ( <REFERENCE> at para. 14-17 and <REFERENCE> ; 2009 FC 435). The Applicant relies principally on the ruling made <REFERENCE> Khan . However, this case is distinguishable given that it was decided in the absence of an interview to determine the legitimacy of the marriage. Such an interview was held in the circumstances at bar. I agree with the analysis of my colleague Justice Snider <TARGETCASE> Singh at paragraphs 14-16, where she distinguished the Khan case on this basis as follows: <REFERENCE> ""The Applicant did not have an oral hearing or interview with the Officer.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [42] A recent decision of this Court which dealt with Blencoe was the decision of Madam Justice Tremblay-Lamer in Canada (Minister of Citizenship and <REFERENCE> FTR 196, which dealt with citizenship revocation. She pointed out that an analysis of the reasonableness of administrative delay in a particular case is factual and contextual. She said at paragraph 56: <REFERENCE> In these circumstances I find that the delays which have marred these proceedings are inordinate and indeed unconscionable. Nothing in the circumstances of the case justified them. They are not the consequence of the complexity of the case or of any dilatory tactics employed by the Defendants, but of bureaucratic indolence and failure to give the matter the attention it deserved given the rights and interests at stake. The evidence clearly establishes that the Defendants had repeatedly admitted to the misrepresentations and that all the information necessary to proceed with the revocation of their citizenship was already available to CIC. <REFERENCE> In this case, Mr. Beltran misrepresented nothing, and all the information necessary to proceed with an admissibility hearing was available for more than twenty years. <TARGETCASE> ","An analysis of the reasonableness of administrative delay in a particular case is factual and contextual, and inordinate and unconscionable delays are not justified by the complexity of the case or any dilatory tactics employed by the Defendants, but are due to bureaucratic indolence and failure to give the matter the attention it deserved given the rights and interests at stake."

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [41] Although the Act , or section 40 specifically, does not require spontaneous disclosure of all information or evidence, there may be an obligation to disclose information or to produce relevant evidence in certain circumstances. Section 16(1) of the Act provides that ""[a] person who makes an application must answer truthfully all questions put to them for the purpose of the examination and must answer truthfully all questions put to them for the purpose of the examination and must produce a visa and all relevant evidence and documents that the officer reasonably requires."" <REFERENCE> at para. 15, the Court recognized that a foreign national seeking to enter Canada has a ""duty of candour"" which requires disclosure of material facts.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [4] The applicant alleges that the Board ignored and misinterpreted the documentary evidence. Specifically, the applicant alleges that the Board failed to mention evidence suggesting that police routinely make use of torture when they investigate suspects and that the applicant faces a risk from a militancy that, albeit defeated, remains active. It has been established that a tribunal must be presumed to have considered all of the evidence that was presented to it, and it is not obligated to mention in its reasons all the evidence it has taken into account before rendering its decision (see <TARGETCASE> (T.D.) (QL)). The assessment and the weight to be given documents is a matter within the discretion of the tribunal evaluating the evidence ( <REFERENCE> (T.D.) (QL)). A review of the Board's decision and the hearing transcripts reveals that the Board appropriately considered all of the documentary evidence before rendering its decision. It is important to note that the applicant's counsel made representations with respect to the Amnesty International report and that the Board specifically addresses the issue of torture raised in that report.","A tribunal must be presumed to have considered all of the evidence that was presented to it, and it is not obligated to mention in its reasons all the evidence it has taken into account before rendering its decision."

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [28] As this Court pointed out in the recent case of REFERENCE, sheer volume and diversity of country conditions documents will often make it administratively impractical to require a decision-maker to spell out exactly how much weight it assigns to every document ( REFERENCE). However, as this Court also pointed out in TARGETCASE , above, if the overlooked contrary evidence is overwhelming and the decision-maker does not explain what documentary evidence supports its conclusions, then it may be easier to conclude that the decision was unreasonable ( REFERENCE). ","If the overlooked contrary evidence is overwhelming and the decision-maker does not explain what documentary evidence supports its conclusions, then it may be easier to conclude that the decision was unreasonable."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [29] However, in <REFERENCE> to 17, 427 FTR 87 [ <REFERENCE> ], Madam Justice Mary Gleason observed that this sits uncomfortably with Supreme Court jurisprudence that says that reasonableness should be presumed where a decision-maker is interpreting its enabling legislation (see <TARGETCASE> at paragraph 54; Canada (Minister of Citizenship and <REFERENCE> [ <REFERENCE> ]). I share Justice Gleason's unease. The analysis in <REFERENCE> is summary and does not explain why the presumption of reasonableness was rebutted. Further, in <REFERENCE> DLR (4th) 411, the Supreme Court of Canada said that reasonableness was the standard when the Minister interpreted a similar discretionary exemption power under what was then subsection 34(2) of the Act. ",Reasonableness should be presumed where a decision-maker is interpreting its enabling legislation.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: Justice Yves de Montigny held that a high level of procedural fairness must inform a Citizenship Judge's decision-making process. In coming to this conclusion, he noted that the Supreme Court in <REFERENCE> at p. 682, advised that ""the concept of procedural fairness is eminently variable and its content is to be decided in the specific context of each case."" He relied on the subsequent Supreme Court decision in <REFERENCE> D.L.R.(4th) 193 at paragraphs 22 et seq. to determine the content of the duty of fairness in citizenship cases. In Baker , above, the court developed a list of factors to aid in this assessment: the nature of the decision, the statutory scheme, the importance of the decision to the individual affected, the legitimate expectations of the individual, and the decision-maker's choice of procedures. Accordingly, Justice de Montigny held at paragraphs 15-16 that: <TARGETCASE> ""[...] a fairly high standard of procedural fairness must inform the decision-making process followed in a citizenship application.",A fairly high standard of procedural fairness must inform the decision-making process followed in a citizenship application.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [115] While the dissenting judges in Penner suggest that the majority departed from <REFERENCE> , the majority did not specifically refer to Figliola. However, the majority commented, at para 31, that the legal framework established in <TARGETCASE> [ <REFERENCE> , which governs the exercise of the court's discretion to suspend the application of issue estoppel, has not been overtaken by ""subsequent jurisprudence"", which would include <REFERENCE> .

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [82] In <TARGETCASE> , supra at para 43, Justice Bédard stated that a factual objection at the section 41 stage is ""an indication"" that some investigation is required. I do not read <REFERENCE> to mandate that the Commission deal with a complaint where there are factual disagreements between the complainant and the respondent. As discussed above, to adopt such an approach would mean that the Commission would never be able to dismiss a complaint involving a factual dispute at the section 41 stage, despite the Commission's consideration of the respondent's submissions. As noted above, such a result appears to be inconsistent with the discretion accorded to the Commission under section 41 and the gatekeeping purposes underlying the section. ",A factual objection at the section 41 stage is an indication that some investigation is required.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [53] The difficulty in assessing the value of lost goods is that, unless there is a published exchange of prices for those goods, one can never predict what the market value of those goods was, because they were never there. This should be no obstacle, however, for the Court to do as best it can to compensate the Plaintiff for his loss. As the Supreme Court of Canada said in <REFERENCE> ; 4 N.R. 1, at pp. 279-280 <REFERENCE> : ""The difficulty in fixing an amount of damages was dealt with in the well known English case of <REFERENCE> ], where at pp. 49-50, Meredith, C.J.O., said: 'There are, no doubt, cases in which it is impossible to say that there is any loss assessable as damages resulting from the breach of a contract, but the Courts have gone a long way in holding that difficulty in ascertaining the amount of the loss is no reason for not giving substantial damages, and perhaps the furthest they have gone in that direction is in <TARGETCASE> .",Difficulty in ascertaining the amount of the loss is no reason for not giving substantial damages.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [40] Contrary to what the applicant claims, the issue of whether a visa officer should hold an interview will only arise when the credibility, accuracy or genuine nature of the information submitted by an applicant in support of his or her visa application is the basis of the visa officer's concerns ( <REFERENCE> at para 24). As Mr. Justice Roy stated in <TARGETCASE> : In other words, the rules of natural justice may require that additional questions be asked if the evidence would have been sufficient had it not been for doubts regarding the credibility, accuracy or genuine nature of information submitted by the applicant in support of his or her application. However, if the application itself is insufficient, there is no duty to contact the applicant to ask him or her to bolster the application. ","The rules of natural justice may require that additional questions be asked if the evidence would have been sufficient had it not been for doubts regarding the credibility, accuracy or genuine nature of information submitted by the applicant in support of his or her application.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [15] The Supreme Court of Canada in TARGETCASE held that a standard of review analysis need not be conducted in every instance. Instead, where the standard of review applicable to a particular question before the court is well-settled by past jurisprudence, the reviewing court may adopt that standard of review. Only where this search proves fruitless must the reviewing court undertake a consideration of the four factors comprising the standard of review analysis.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [7] It is well established that ""adequate reasons are those that serve the functions for which the duty to provide them was imposed"": <TARGETCASE> (QL) at para. 21. In the administrative law context, the purpose for providing reasons includes: fairness to the parties, justification, transparency and intelligibility: <REFERENCE> at para. 47.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [36] The leading case on the extent of a Court's discretion to grant judgment pursuant to the Rule 9-7 summary trial procedure is <REFERENCE> ; 36 C.P.C.(2d) 199 (C.A.). In that case, the British Columbia Court of Appeal, at paragraph 48, set out a number of factors to be considered: <TARGETCASE> ""In deciding whether it will be unjust to give judgment the chambers judge is entitled to consider, inter alia, the amount involved, the complexity of the matter, its urgency, any prejudice likely to arise by reason of delay, the cost of taking the case forward to a conventional trial in relation to the amount involved, the course of the proceedings and any other matters which arise for consideration on this important question. <REFERENCE> ","In deciding whether it will be unjust to give judgment the chambers judge is entitled to consider, inter alia, the amount involved, the complexity of the matter, its urgency, any prejudice likely to arise by reason of delay, the cost of taking the case forward to a conventional trial in relation to the amount involved, the course of the proceedings and any other matters which arise for consideration on this important question."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [13] While the Applicant relies on Nino <REFERENCE> , in my view, the circumstances in that case are distinct. There, the decision was found to be unreasonable because the Board failed to assess credibility and personal risk which caused it to overlook material evidence contradicting its conclusion on state protection. Put otherwise, it made a state protection finding without a proper evidentiary framework and without regard to the personal circumstances of the claimants. That is not the situation in this case. Here, the Board implicitly accepted the Applicants' evidence of past persecution and risk and considered the specific risks that they feared. Therefore, the issue was whether, upon considering all the evidence, the Applicants could safely reside in Cali. In any event, a failure to make such a finding is not necessarily fatal even in the state protection context ( <TARGETCASE> ). Country Conditions and Risk ",A failure to make a state protection finding is not necessarily fatal in the state protection context.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [46] Insofar as other authorities cited by the Applicant are concerned, some characterized the test in terms of the ability of a state to provide ""effective"" protection (see, for example, <REFERENCE> at para. 44; and <TARGETCASE> at para. 34), while some characterized the test in terms of the ability of the state to provide ""adequate"" state protection (see, for example, <REFERENCE> , above, at para. 37; <REFERENCE> , at paras. 33 to 35).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [34] Some decisions of this Court have held that the RAD does not commit a reviewable error when it applies the standard of reasonableness to findings of pure credibility ( <REFERENCE> ; <TARGETCASE> , <REFERENCE> ; Yin ). However, as explained by Justice Simon Noël in <REFERENCE> at para 32, this Court will uphold the RAD's application of the reasonableness standard to the RPD's findings of credibility only when it is clear that the RAD has in fact conducted its own assessment of the evidence. This is also the thrust of Justice Shore's decision in <REFERENCE> where he notes that in cases involving findings of pure credibility, the point is not which standard was applied but rather ""whether the RAD conducted an independent assessment of the evidence as a whole."" ","The RAD does not commit a reviewable error when it applies the standard of reasonableness to findings of pure credibility, provided it has conducted its own assessment of the evidence."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [70] ""Terrorism"" is not defined in the statute. The term has also been given an unrestricted and broad interpretation in the jurisprudence. <TARGETCASE> ; 281 N.R. 1; 2002 SCC 1 at paragraph 98, the Supreme Court defined the word, in the context of the former Act and, following the language of the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism , as including: ""... any 'act intended to cause death or serious bodily injury to civilians, or to any other person not taking an active part in the hostilities in a situation of armed conflict when the purpose of such act, by its nature or context, is to intimidate a population, or to compel a government or an international organization to do or abstain from doing any act'.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [36] This Court has repeatedly held that the purpose of paragraph 40(1)( a ) of the Act is to ensure that applicants provide complete, honest and truthful information in every manner when applying for entry into Canada.

ICI's '263 Patent is directed generally to fungicidal triazoles and imidazoles. Fluconazole is not specifically described and neither were its superior and previously unknown efficacy described or known. The ICI Patent did not include the fluconazole compound.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [40] Finally, in a situation which has certain analogies with the one at bar, this court refused to regard the question of separate proceedings as a strong reason. In Can-Am Produce and <TARGETCASE> (F.C.A.), the Court of Appeal was faced with an instance in which there were a number of factors, in favour of denying a stay, including that many witnesses were in Quebec and that there was a cross-demand which could not be dealt with through arbitration in England. This latter aspect is analogous to the separate claim, in the present proceedings, against Empire Stevedoring Company Ltd. for failing to properly care for the cargo while the container was in their hands in Vancouver. Mr. Justice Pratte, who wrote the principal reasons in the 'Seapearl' , pointed out that 'As a rule, it is certainly in the interests of justice that contractual undertakings be honoured.' (p. 176) and concluded that the party seeking to deny the stay had failed to show sufficiently strong reasons why it should not be held to its contract. ""","As a rule, it is certainly in the interests of justice that contractual undertakings be honoured."" The party seeking to deny the stay had failed to show sufficiently strong reasons why it should not be held to its contract."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [26] This Court finds that the RPD unreasonably determined that the Applicant had not proven his identity. The Respondent is correct that the RPD may draw an adverse credibility inference from an absence of corroborating evidence, ""especially when an applicant makes no effort to obtain [it]"" ( <REFERENCE> ). The Respondent is also correct that the RPD may consider the validity or authenticity, especially, if fraudulent documents can be easily obtained in a country of origin of an applicant ( <TARGETCASE> ). In the present case, the driver's license was authenticated by the Nigeria High Commission (Certified Tribunal Record [CTR] at p 196). While the Applicant's birth certificate did not contain sufficient identifying data and security features to be subject to forensic investigation, it gives the birth date and bears a recent photograph of the Applicant (CTR at p 273). Consequently, the Applicant's birth certificate could be compared with his authenticated driver's license to further establish his identity. ","The RPD may consider the validity or authenticity of documents, especially if fraudulent documents can be easily obtained in a country of origin of an applicant."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [51] The Respondent points out that the Officer's reasons refer to the Uddin case as having informed her analysis, in particular the included quote from <TARGETCASE> (FCTD), which stated: <REFERENCE> I return to my observation that the evidence suggests that the applicants would be a welcome addition to the Canadian community. Unfortunately, that is not the test. To make it the test is to make the H & C process an ex post facto screening device which supplants the screening process contained in the Immigration Act and Regulations . This would encourage gambling on refugee claims in the belief that if someone can stay in Canada long enough to demonstrate that they are the kind of persons Canada wants, they would be allowed to stay. The H & C process is not designed to eliminate hardship; it is designed to provide relief from unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship. There is no doubt that the refusal of an applicants' H & C application will cause hardship but, given the circumstances of the applicants' presence in Canada and the state of the record, it is not unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship. . . . <REFERENCE> ","The H & C process is not designed to eliminate hardship; it is designed to provide relief from unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [28] I am ready to accept that a negative credibility determination in respect of a refugee claim under section 96 is not necessarily dispositive of the considerations under section 97(1) since the elements required to establish a claim under section 97 differ from those required under section 96 ( <TARGETCASE> and <REFERENCE> ). Ultimately, whether a Board properly considered both claims must be determined on a case by case basis with regard to the different elements required to establish each claim ( <REFERENCE> ). However, the failure to conduct a separate section 97 analysis will not be fatal in all circumstances ( <REFERENCE> 2004 FC 635; <REFERENCE> ), especially if the facts and the grounds for seeking protection (here, on a Convention ground) are the same and the claimant's story is not credible ( <REFERENCE> 2004 FC 79).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [6] The Respondent provides a different account. According to the Respondent, the Applicant went to Ukraine in June 2011 not with the intention of staying there permanently, but of bringing the children back to Canada and circumventing Ukraine's laws regarding international adoptions. Foreigners and Ukrainian citizens living abroad need the approval of Ukraine's Ministry of Social Policy to adopt Ukrainian children, and cannot adopt children under five years of age, who can only be adopted through domestic adoptions. In the Respondent's view, the Applicant misrepresented both her residency and marital status in order to complete the domestic adoptions, and these adoptions were therefore not in accordance with Ukrainian law.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [19] Madam Justice L'Heureux-Dubé also referred to the reasons rendered by Mr. Justice Iacobucci in Director of Investigation and <TARGETCASE> , where he stated at pages 776-777 <REFERENCE> : ""[para 56] I conclude that the third standard should be whether the decision of the Tribunal is unreasonable . This test is to be distinguished from the most deferential standard of review, which requires courts to consider whether a tribunal's decision is patently unreasonable. An unreasonable decision is one that, in the main, is not supported by any reasons that can stand up to a somewhat probing examination. Accordingly, a court reviewing a conclusion on the reasonableness standard must look to see whether any reasons support it. The defect, if there is one, could presumably be in the evidentiary foundation itself or in the logical process by which conclusions are sought to be drawn from it. An example of the former kind of defect would be an assumption that had no basis in the evidence, or that was contrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence.","The third standard of review should be whether the decision of the Tribunal is unreasonable, distinguished from the most deferential standard of review, which requires courts to consider whether a tribunal's decision is patently unreasonable."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [9] The serious issue raised in the application for leave to commence judicial review proceedings is said to be denial, by decision [of] the tribunal, of the applicant's opportunity to raise constitutional arguments, based on the Charter , that are said to be preliminary to the determination of the question of a credible basis for the applicant's claim to refugee status. There is no doubt that such issues, if raised, are within the jurisdiction of the tribunal in determining the law applicable to this case ( <TARGETCASE> (F.C.T.D.), per <REFERENCE> (F.C.T.D.), per Jerome, A.C.J. (F.C.T.D.)). The denial of opportunity to consider submissions on the issue is likely to be perceived as raising an arguable issue, indeed, without attempting to prejudge the ultimate determination on the application for leave since affidavit evidence and argument are not yet filed, it is in my view that is likely to be perceived as a serious issue.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [31] The onus is on the applicant to satisfy the officer of all parts of her application. The officer is under no obligation to ask for additional information where the applicant's material is insufficient. Nor is the officer obliged to provide the applicant with several opportunities to satisfy points she may have overlooked (see <REFERENCE> (QL) at paragraph 6). That said, the applicant was given several opportunities to have her case heard. She was interviewed by the officer, provided with a letter indicating what she needed to present in order to complete her application, the officer called her to remind her about the pending documents and then she was given another opportunity to submit the required documents. This meets the requirements of procedural fairness. <TARGETCASE> ","The officer is under no obligation to ask for additional information where the applicant's material is insufficient, nor to provide the applicant with several opportunities to satisfy points she may have overlooked."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: The applicant submits that the Board erred in law in its misinterpretation of subsection 21(3)(d) of the Act and in its disregard for the statement of Commander L'heureux, by concluding that the applicant was not on duty at the time of the 1959 injury. Subsection 21(3)(d) states the following: <REFERENCE> "" 21(3) For the purposes of subsection (2), an injury or disease, or the aggravation of an injury or disease, shall be presumed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, to have arisen out of or to have been directly connected with military service of the kind described in that subsection if the injury or disease or the aggravation thereof was incurred in the course of <REFERENCE> (d) the transportation of the member while on authorized leave by any means authorized by a military authority, other than public transportation, between the place the member normally performed duties and the place at which the member was to take leave or a place at which public transportation was available; <TARGETCASE> <REFERENCE>","An injury or disease, or the aggravation of an injury or disease, shall be presumed to have arisen out of or to have been directly connected with military service if it was incurred in the course of the transportation of the member while on authorized leave by any means authorized by a military authority."

We know from the officer's reasons that she did not think that the applicants would suffer unusual, undeserved or disproportionate harm if they were required to apply for permanent residence from abroad.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [23] However, here the arguments put forward by the Applicant concern issues related to natural justice and procedural fairness. As a general rule, issues of natural justice and procedural fairness are to be reviewed on the basis of a correctness standard: Canada (Citizenship and <TARGETCASE> ] directs a court, when reviewing a decision challenged on the grounds of procedural fairness, to isolate any act or omission relevant to procedural fairness (at para. 100).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [20] The respondent contends that any question of law at issue in these proceedings is not of central importance to the legal system: REFERENCE. In TARGETCASE, the Supreme Court stated that it should be presumed that the appropriate standard is reasonableness when the decision of the tribunal under review concerns the interpretation or application of its home statute. ",It should be presumed that the appropriate standard is reasonableness when the decision of the tribunal under review concerns the interpretation or application of its home statute.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [25] These principles were subsequently reiterated in paragraph 24 of <REFERENCE> : 24 In assessing the standard of review of inmate grievance decisions, a standard of correctness applies to issues of law, including the interpretation of the Act and Regulations and of the Commissioner's Directives, as well as to issues of procedural fairness. A standard of reasonableness applies to issues of fact and to issues of mixed law and fact, unless an extricable issue of law can be identified, in which case a standard of correctness may apply to that extricable issue: <REFERENCE> N.R. 87 at paragraphs 15-16; <TARGETCASE> in Sweet , Yu and <REFERENCE> concerned grievance decisions, not decisions rendered by ICPs.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [110] It is true that the purpose of consultation is to address concerns regarding new potential adverse impacts. As stated by the Supreme Court in Rio <TARGETCASE> at para 49: ""Prior and continuing breaches, including prior failures to consult, will only trigger a duty to consult if the present decision has the potential of causing a novel adverse impact on a present claim or existing right"". In other words, the scope of the duty to consult does not include past infringements or existing and ongoing impacts of past actions. For the duty to be triggered, there must be a new decision or conduct that may affect Aboriginal rights. The re-issuance of a licence, even if it is similar to the one it is replacing, is certainly sufficient to meet the third requirement underlying the duty to consult (see, for example, <REFERENCE> BCLR (5th) 81). It is a fresh action, so much so that in the absence of the renewed licence, the commercial activity authorized by that licence would have to come to a halt.","Prior and continuing breaches, including prior failures to consult, will only trigger a duty to consult if the present decision has the potential of causing a novel adverse impact on a present claim or existing right""."

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [22] The Applicants submit that the Enforcement Officer erred by declining to defer removal on the simple ground that the H & C application was recently submitted, without at least considering whether such application raised risk factors that had not previously been assessed.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [30] Accordingly, the RPD's finding is reasonable because where a state is capable of providing adequate protection to its citizens, the onus is on the applicant to submit clear and convincing evidence establishing that such protection was not offered to him or her ( TARGETCASE , above). The applicant did not provide a convincing explanation to the RPD, simply stating that the Algerian authorities are sometimes corrupt and that he has no confidence in the police. D. Was it unreasonable for the RPD to find that the fact that the applicant had not sought asylum in France showed a lack of subjective fear?

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [53] Once again, counsel for Lego urged that use of the phrase ""works with leading brand"" amounted to a use by Ritvik of Lego's registered trademark <REFERENCE> . He referred me to <TARGETCASE> 22(1) of the Act , the use by the defendant need not be of the actual registered trademark of the plaintiff. At page 65 of that decision, Mr. Justice Dubé wrote: ""Of more significance, however, is that the defendant is depreciating the value of the goodwill attached to Perrier's marks contrary to the provisions of s. 22(1) of the Act . The fact that the defendant intends to produce a spoof does not take away from the deception created in the minds of the customers. The defendant is clearly attempting to cash in on the well-established reputation of Perrier and the deception, in my view, tends to dilute the quality of its trade marks, to impair its business integrity established over the years, and to cause injury to its goodwill.",The use by the defendant need not be of the actual registered trademark of the plaintiff for it to depreciate the value of the goodwill attached to the plaintiff's marks.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [23] In this case, the Officer erred by sending the request with regard to the H&C to Ms. Rwigamba.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [25] Finally, counsel for the applicants contended in her written submissions that the PRRA officer failed to address the best interests of the children. She was well advised, however, to abandon this argument at the hearing. It is now well established that an assessment under sections 96 and 97 of the IRPA does not necessitate consideration of the best interests of the children. As the Federal Court of Appeal wrote in <REFERENCE> at para. 13: <REFERENCE> ""Neither the Charter nor the Convention on the Rights of the Child requires that the interests of affected children be considered under every provision of IRPA : de <REFERENCE> at para. 105. If a statutory scheme provides an effective opportunity for considering the interests of any affected children, including those born Canada [sic], such as is provided by subsection 25(1), they do not also have to be considered before the making of every decision which may adversely affect them. Hence, it was an error for the Application Judge to read into the statutory provisions defining the scope of the PRRA officer's task a duty also to consider the interests of the adult respondents' Canadian-born children. <TARGETCASE> ","An assessment under sections 96 and 97 of the IRPA does not necessitate consideration of the best interests of the children, and it is not required to consider the interests of affected children before making every decision which may adversely affect them."

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [28] Moreover, in this instance, the Tribunal's finding of disability centres less on Mr. Mills' actual physical condition than VIA's perception of his ailment. If the employer attributes greater limitations to a known condition than are actually present, then the employee has effectively been labelled disabled: <REFERENCE> perception is necessary because human rights legislation is directed against preventing the effects of discriminatory behaviour. Consider for example the case of a partially sighted individual who is denied employment opportunities because an employer has the mistaken impression that his or her vision is worse than it actually is. Has discrimination on the basis of disability not occurred? Should the individual with vision problems be left without a remedy under the CHRA ? This issue comes into even sharper focus in a context other than disability. What if a woman is not hired because she is perceived to be aboriginal and the employer harbours prejudiced views about the suitability of native workers? All would agree that the employer should not escape the censure of the law if the worker in this instance is not in fact of First Nations descent. <TARGETCASE> ","If the employer attributes greater limitations to a known condition than are actually present, then the employee has effectively been labelled disabled: perception is necessary because human rights legislation is directed against preventing the effects of discriminatory behaviour."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [20] As this is a motion to strike, the allegations in the notice of application must be accepted as true.

If the Tax Court has exclusive original jurisdiction over the issues in this Application then this Application is ""clearly futile"" and it is ""plain and obvious"" that it is bereft of any possibility of success.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [37] Nor do I find it plain and obvious that the plaintiff is barred from bringing a claim based on the defendant's alleged failure to inform him that he had been deliberately poisoned while serving <REFERENCE> . Ostensibly, this is a claim of negligent conduct that aggravated a disability within the meaning of section 111 of the Pension Act .

Officer Stopford was discharged from the military on June 26, 1998. He was not informed by the defendant of the poisoning allegations until August 7, 1999. Mr. Stopford bases his claim both on the defendant's failure to inform him, before and after his discharge, and on the ""uncaring and impersonal manner"" in which he was eventually informed, which, again, occurred after his discharge. Whether the scope of the relevant statutory bars cover alleged torts or breaches of fiduciary duties committed by the defendant against a plaintiff after he or she has been discharged from military service raises a serious question of law that is proper for determination on its merits.

In <TARGETCASE> [see footnote 6], Mr. Justice Iacobucci, for the court, wrote: <REFERENCE> ""The better view, as I have stated, is that the right to reformulate is premised on the inherant right of an owner of property to deal with that property as he or she sees fit. In the absence of some express term in the compulsory licence, prohibiting purchasers of bulk Nizatidine from Novopharm from reformulating it into final-dosage form, the weight of the caselaw supports the view that Apotex, having validly acquired the bulk medicine, would be free to reformulate it for resale without fear of infringing any right under Eli Lilly's Patents. <REFERENCE> While there is no compulsory licence here at issue, certainly there was no evidence before me that Novopharm, as a purchaser of bulk enalapril maleate from Delmar was in any way prohibited from reformulating that bulk enalapril maleate into final-dosage form. <REFERENCE> ","The right to reformulate is premised on the inherent right of an owner of property to deal with that property as he or she sees fit, and in the absence of some express term in the compulsory licence, purchasers of bulk medicine would be free to reformulate it for resale without fear of infringing any right under patents."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [1] Shore, J. [Translation]: Section 101 of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act , SC 1992, c 20 [CCRA], establishes guiding principles to assist the National Parole Board Appeal Division [NPBAD] in making decisions regarding conditional release. In TARGETCASE, the Supreme Court of Canada said the following about the criteria applicable at the time: There remains then the third and most important criterion, namely whether the offender constitutes an undue risk to society. If an inmate's release continues to constitute an undue risk to the public, then his or her detention can be justifiably maintained for a lifetime. There can be no doubt that in the ordinary course of events the assessment as to whether or not an inmate's release would pose an undue risk to the community is best left in the discretion of the experts who participate in the Parole Board review decisions. However, in light of the inordinate length of Steele's period of incarceration, it is appropriate to consider whether the Board erred in its evaluation that Steele did in fact constitute a danger to the community.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [22] The presumption endorsed in Alberta Teachers , however, is not carved in stone. First, this Court has long recognized that certain categories of questions - even when they involve the interpretation of a home statute - warrant review on a correctness standard ( <REFERENCE> , at paras. 58-61). Second, we have also said that a contextual analysis may ""rebut the presumption of reasonableness review for questions involving the interpretation of the home statute"" ( <TARGETCASE> , at para. 16) ....

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: ""Reasonable grounds to believe"" is the appropriate standard for judges to apply when reviewing a continuation of detention under the certificate provisions of the IRPA . The IRPA therefore does not ask the designated judge to be deferential, but, rather, asks him or her to engage in a searching review. The same approach and logic should be followed for reviews of conditions of release of detention. I do not read the teaching of the Supreme Court of Canada referred to above in REFERENCE and REFERENCEas suggesting a different approach. On the contrary, they both complement each other. The designated judge has to perform the searching review based on an objectively reasonable suspicion anchored on facts showing that harm resulting from the danger is substantial and not merely negligible. This searching review must be completed on the standard of ""reasonable grounds to believe"" as clearly mentioned in REFERENCE . This is the approach followed by Justice Blanchard in all of his reviews of conditions of release pertaining to Mr. Mahjoub (see REFERENCE; TARGETCASE; REFERENCE).",The designated judge has to perform the searching review based on an objectively reasonable suspicion anchored on facts showing that harm resulting from the danger is substantial and not merely negligible.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [14] In his second application to reopen the vacation proceedings, Mr. Seyoboka relied on decisions of the ICTR in which it acquitted both General Kabiligi and Protais Zigiranyrazo. In the former, the ICTR found credibility problems with DAS' testimony. In the latter, no evidence was led about the events at the roadblock where Mr. Seyoboka had allegedly served. Mr. Seyoboka submitted that these decisions showed that the Board had relied on faulty evidence when it vacated his refugee protection and that this amounted to a breach of natural justice. <TARGETCASE> ",These decisions showed that the Board had relied on faulty evidence when it vacated his refugee protection and that this amounted to a breach of natural justice.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [38] Mr. Nalliah submits that, if the Court is satisfied that where a serious issue and irreparable harm are made out, a balance of convenience will flow with him ( <REFERENCE> ; 55 F.T.R. 104 (T.D.). See also <TARGETCASE> ; 58 F.T.R. 292 (T.D.); Suresh , supra). This final argument can be countered quite simply since I am not satisfied that irreparable harm has been made out. Even if I were satisfied, however, I believe that the consequences to the Respondents must be examined prior to making a determination on this branch of the test. <REFERENCE> ","If a serious issue and irreparable harm are made out, a balance of convenience will flow with the claimant."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [413] In <TARGETCASE> , the Supreme Court of Canada reviewed the legal principles applicable to obviousness and took the opportunity to provide practical guidelines as to the approach that should be adopted in an obviousness inquiry. At para. 67, Justice Rothstein explains that: ""It will be useful in an obviousness inquiry to follow the four-step approach first outlined by Oliver, L.J., in <REFERENCE> (C.A.).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [63] With this background in mind, I turn to the Court of Appeal's recent pronouncements <REFERENCE> FCA . The Court left no doubt that the bare assertion of general adverse conditions in the country of removal is not enough. At para 41, Justice Stratas stated: <REFERENCE> The Federal Court has repeatedly interpreted subsection 25(1) as requiring proof that the applicant will personally suffer unusual and undeserved, or disproportionate hardship arising from the application of what I have called the normal rule ... <REFERENCE> [Emphasis added] <TARGETCASE> ","The applicant must provide proof that they will personally suffer unusual and undeserved, or disproportionate hardship arising from the application of the normal rule."

After citing various authorities, he said: <REFERENCE> ""The principle developed in these cases is simply an extension of the rules of natural justice and procedural fairness. It affords a party affected by the decision of a public official an opportunity to make representations in circumstances in which there otherwise would be no such opportunity.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [17] The applicant argues that the designated member of the PAB erred in granting the respondent leave to appeal the decision of the Review Tribunal because the respondent did not have an arguable case. In essence, it is submitted, the Member treated the application for leave as an appeal as of right. However, the leave application disclosed no new evidence, no error of law nor any error of significant fact. Thus, the applicant contends, no case for leave was presented. <TARGETCASE> ","The respondent did not have an arguable case for leave to appeal because the leave application disclosed no new evidence, no error of law nor any error of significant fact."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [48] In addition to finding that the AFRC had a limited and brutal purpose, the Board also referred to the applicant as being a ""knowing participant"", and having ""willingly subscribed to the ideology"" of the organization. The Board relied in particular on the applicant's leadership position within the organization, his rise through the ranks, and the fact that the applicant stayed with the organization for the entire time it was in power in reaching these conclusions. As was specified by the Court of Appeal <TARGETCASE> at paragraph 13: ""... the closer one is to a position of leadership or command within an organization, the easier it will be to draw an inference of awareness of the crimes and participation in the plan to commit the crimes"". <REFERENCE> ","The closer one is to a position of leadership or command within an organization, the easier it will be to draw an inference of awareness of the crimes and participation in the plan to commit the crimes."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [37] It is clear from the officer's decision, that she gave much weight to the CSIS and CTS reports in reaching her decision. The officer relied on inconsistencies between the different interviews and clearly followed the recommendations set out in the CTS memorandum.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [26] In an application made pursuant to section 25 of the IRPA, the H&C officer's role is to assess if the applicants would face unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship if they were to file their application for permanent residence from outside Canada in the usual manner provided at section 11 of the <REFERENCE> ). Aside from the crucial importance of the best interests of the child directly affected by the decision under review, to which the officer is required to be ""alert, alive and sensitive"" ( <TARGETCASE> at para 75), it is imperative to ensure that the applicants have had the opportunity to satisfy the officer of the hardship that they may encounter as a result of lack of the services required by Josémaria's condition, and counter the officer's conclusion regarding the availability of such services in Mexico. This was not done in the applicants' case.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [55] The Applicant submits that although the Board may not have been required to make a finding on his current dangerousness to the Canadian public, the Board ought to have considered that factor in its analysis. He argues that the Board's reasons make it clear that it considered itself obliged to exclude the Applicant despite his apparent rehabilitation.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [17] Mr. Justice Bowman touches upon the concepts of fairness and justice. The counterpart to that is prejudice to a respondent in allowing an amendment. The Court of Appeal, in <REFERENCE> (F.C.A.), pointed out that prejudice to a respondent is not measured by whether an amendment will make the case more difficult for the other side to win: ""The fact that the proposed amendments might make the case more difficult for a party to win is not the kind of prejudice that is in issue on motions to amend the pleadings."" (Page 613) Nor is it a major consideration that an amendment will expose a party to increased financial liability: <TARGETCASE> (T.D.), at 418, where Madame Justice Reed pointed out that the main prejudice to the Crown, arising from the amendment, would be increased financial liability but that this did not weigh ""heavily enough in the balance to justify denying the amendment."".

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [11] On credibility findings, I have noted the reluctance that this Court has, and should have, to overturn such findings except in the clearest case of error ( <TARGETCASE> ). The deference owed acknowledges both the contextual circumstances and legislative intent, as well as the unique position that a trier of fact has to assess testimonial evidence. That deference is influenced by the basis upon which credibility is found. The standard is reasonableness subject to a significant measure of deference to the Immigration and Refugee Board.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [35] In the circumstances, it was open to the CDS to find that whether the applicant was legally obliged to comply with the requests of the SSRRB was not material. Once the CF and the SSRRB were seized of the matter, they could have been held liable for having approved or having failed to properly exercise their authority with respect to the administration of the survey. It is important to note that in the initial SSRRB review, Ms. Bowser clearly stated that ""although cadets are not CF personnel, the DND/CF is responsible through the VCDS to administer and manager the Cadets Canada Programme."" Furthermore, it was not insignificant that the applicant accepted personal responsibility to comply with any procedures and policies within the SSRRB and the CF under the supervision of the Director of the Cadets programme or other delegated authority and it was reasonable for the CDS to take this fact into account in deciding whether the applicant was bound by the approval process. <TARGETCASE> ","Once the CF and the SSRRB were seized of the matter, they could have been held liable for having approved or having failed to properly exercise their authority with respect to the administration of the survey."

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [70] I have no difficulty with the point that purposive construction is capable of expanding or limiting a literal text: see Whirlpool , above, at para 49. It seems to me, though, that there is some judicial concern about importing essential features of an invention from the disclosure to the claims, particularly where the disclosure is somewhat unclear about the scope of the invention. In other words, even if one resorts to the disclosure to interpret the claims ""the precise and exact extent of the exclusive property and privilege claimed"" must always be identifiable: see <REFERENCE> [ <TARGETCASE> ], the Court declined to read into a patent claim an ""essential"" feature of an invention and struck the patent down because the claims, as written, exceeded the scope of the invention. This decision predates the decisions in Whirlpool and Free World , above, and their elaboration of the principles of purposive construction. Nevertheless, <REFERENCE> has not been overruled and it continues to underscore the importance of ensuring that a patent clearly delineates the subject matter of an invention and the importance of the claims language in achieving that end: see also <REFERENCE> (QL), 72 NR 290 (CA). ","The precise and exact extent of the exclusive property and privilege claimed"" must always be identifiable and a patent claim cannot include an ""essential"" feature of an invention if it exceeds the scope of the invention."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [39] With respect, I do not understand Syntex <REFERENCE> , to be an endorsement of Apotex's position. As I read the decision, the Court of Appeal accepted that the ""trigger"" for the application of s. 8 was the expiry of the patent that had been the subject of the NOC proceedings and a delay by the Minister in issuing the NOC beyond the expiry of that patent. Although, in the case at hand, Apotex is not attempting to ""reach back"", the situation remains that, as of the date of the NOC, the '380 Patent had not expired. I see nothing in either Syntex FC , above, or Syntex <TARGETCASE> , that would change the interpretation of s. 8 of the 1993 Regulations that was determined by Justice Hughes and endorsed by the Court of Appeal. I am bound by that interpretation and Apotex's argument must therefore fail.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [26] The Officer concluded that, although the Applicant said that Nigerian authorities are looking for him, the lack of an arrest warrant or other corroborating document meant he had not shown he faced a risk in Nigeria. In a similar situation, Justice Harrington said in <REFERENCE> that: In my view, the PRRA officer could not have made the decision he did unless he did not believe the claimant. That lack of belief is inherent in his analysis ( <REFERENCE> Imm. L.R. (3d) 227). It seems extraordinary that S.A.'s story was not subjected to an oral examination. See also <TARGETCASE> .

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [27] The Respondent notes that this Court has consistently held that a risk ""faced generally"" means one that is ""prevalent or widespread"" ( <REFERENCE> [ <REFERENCE> ]; <REFERENCE> [ <REFERENCE> ]; <REFERENCE> [ Paz Guifarro ]). It does not mean that it has to be faced by the entire population ( <REFERENCE> , above, at para 26).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [3] As was the case in several matters recently brought before the Court, the main issue in this case was the RAD's application of a reasonableness standard of judicial review to the findings of fact and of mixed fact and law in the RPD's decision.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [18] In my opinion, Ward amends the decision <REFERENCE> in a particularly important respect. Ward makes a clear statement on the quantity and quality of the evidence which a claimant must produce to rebut the presumption of state protection; that is, a claimant is only required to provide some clear and convincing evidence . Therefore, in my opinion, the statement <TARGETCASE> that ""it is not enough for a claimant merely to show that his government has not always been effective at protecting persons in his particular situation"" cannot any longer be applied as a point of law. Thus, evidence of the failure of state authorities to effectively respond to requests from women for protection from violent sexual predators, exclusive of all other evidence, can be found to constitute some clear and convincing evidence that rebuts the presumption of state protection. Whether this finding is made depends on the quality of the evidence produced in the judgment of the decision-maker involved. <REFERENCE> ",A claimant is only required to provide some clear and convincing evidence to rebut the presumption of state protection.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [25] Returning to the prior jurisprudence of the Court, in <REFERENCE> my colleague Madam Justice Mactavish rejected the Minister's argument that the decision of an immigration officer with respect to admissibility under subsection 34(1) of the Act , made prior to a decision with respect to ministerial relief, was not justiciable. She found that such a decision was not interlocutory in nature and that the availability of ministerial relief did not provide an adequate alternate remedy. <TARGETCASE> was recently followed on this point by my colleague Mr. Justice von Finckenstein in <REFERENCE> ; 304 F.T.R. 124; 2006 FC 1412.

The section contemplates an action for detinue in the one case and an action for conversion in the other case. The action is not based on damages occasioned by the infringement, but is founded on the wrongful detention or wrongful sale of the plaintiff's property. Where, therefore, infringing copies have been converted to the defendant's own use, damages for such conversion can be obtained in addition to damages for infringement in respect of the same infringement.""

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [83] Accordingly, in the case at bar it was not any specific acts that made Mr. Fontaine incapable of holding a security clearance, but rather the fact that he is associated with individuals who might have a negative influence on him that gives the Minister reason to believe that Mr. Fontaine might be ""prone or induced to ... commit an act that may unlawfully interfere with civil aviation"" (Clearance Program, supra, s.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [22] The issue as to whether the PSIC's decision to decline to investigate is reasonable raises a mixed question of fact and law and is to be assessed on the reasonableness standard of review (REFERENCE; TARGETCASE, upheld by the Federal Court of Appeal in REFERENCE). The reviewing court will only intervene if it concludes the decision is unreasonable and falls outside the ""range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law"" ( REFERENCE). The reasonableness standard also means that the reviewing court must give deference to the decision maker ""as long as the process and the outcome fit comfortably with the principles of justification, transparency and intelligibility, it is not open to a reviewing court to substitute its own view on a preferable outcome"" ( REFERENCE).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [31] <TARGETCASE> Applicant’s third claim for refugee protection, but first claim under the consolidated grounds under the IRPA. The claim was heard, and the panel rejected the Applicant’s claim. In so doing, it applied the doctrine of res judicata but also found the Applicant was not a person in need of protection. The matter was heard before Justice Johanne Gauthier who dismissed the application for judicial review. Justice Gauthier determined that the Board did not err in applying the doctrine of res judicata to the Applicant’s claim under s. 96 of the IRPA; however, that res judicata could not apply to the claim under s. 97 as this was a new ground not previously reviewed. “But, I am satisfied that his error is not determinative, because the RPD also said that the documentary evidence produced did not support a finding that he faces more than a mere possibility of persecution, particularly in view of the fact that he was unable to adduce satisfactory evidence of his involvement in the MQM…” ","The Board did not err in applying the doctrine of res judicata to the Applicant’s claim under s. 96 of the IRPA; however, res judicata could not apply to the claim under s. 97 as this was a new ground not previously reviewed."

Furthermore, although there is Danish legislation in place which requires mandatory reporting of child abuse, this did not happen in the case at bar. The Board found the applicants were exposed to abuse which constituted cruel and unusual punishment.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [9] Before reviewing the RPD's reasons, I wish to note, as did the Respondents, that in REFERENCE, the Supreme Court of Canada held that the adequacy of reasons is not a stand-alone basis for quashing a decision and that any challenge to the reasoning/result of a decision should therefore be made within the reasonableness standard of review. In REFERENCE, the Supreme Court explained what is required of a tribunal's reasons in order to meet the REFERENCE criteria: Reasons may not include all the arguments, statutory provisions, jurisprudence or other details the reviewing judge would have preferred, but that does not impugn the validity of either the reasons or the result under a reasonableness analysis. A decision-maker is not required to make an explicit finding on each constituent element, however subordinate, leading to its final conclusion ( REFERENCE). In other words, if the reasons allow the reviewing court to understand why the tribunal made its decision and permit it to determine whether the conclusion is within the range of acceptable outcomes, the TARGETCASE criteria are met.

The general principle applies when the decision of the court will not have the effect of resolving some controversy which affects or may affect the rights of the parties. If the decision of the court will have no practical effect on such rights, the court will decline to decide the case. This essential ingredient must be present not only when the action or proceeding is commenced but at the time when the court is called upon to reach a decision.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [62] I fail to see where one the applicant's equality rights has been violated. A fundamental principle of immigration law is that noncitizens do not have an unqualified right to enter or remain in the country. Indeed, the distinction between citizens and noncitizens is recognized in s. 6 of the Charter . While permanent residents are given the right to move to, take up residence in, and pursue the gaining of a livelihood in any province in s. 6(2), only citizens are accorded the right ""to enter, remain in and leave Canada"" in s. 6(1). The Supreme Court in <REFERENCE> , affirmed that a difference in treatment between citizens and noncitizens with respect to the right to remain in Canada is not a violation of equality. Sopinka, J., at 736 S.C.R., stated: <TARGETCASE> ""As I have already observed, s. 6 of the Charter specifically provides for differential treatment of citizens and permanent residents in this regard. While permanent residents are given various mobility rights in s. 6(2), only citizens are accorded the right to enter, remain in and leave Canada in s. 6(1).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [15] The law with respect to credibility findings is well settled in <TARGETCASE> : With respect to making negative credibility findings in general, and implausibility findings in particular, Justice Muldoon in <REFERENCE> (C.A.) at 305, that when a refugee claimant swears to the truth of certain allegations, a presumption is created that those allegations are true unless there are reasons to doubt their truthfulness. But the tribunal does not apply the <REFERENCE> principle to this applicant, and repeatedly disregards his testimony, holding that much of it appears to it to be implausible. Additionally, the tribunal often substitutes its own version of events without evidence to support its conclusions. 7. A tribunal may make adverse findings of credibility based on the implausibility of an applicant's story provided the inferences drawn can be reasonably said to exist. However, plausibility findings should be made only in the clearest of cases, i.e., if the facts as presented are outside the realm of what could reasonably be expected, or where the documentary evidence demonstrates that the events could not have happened in the manner asserted by the claimant .","When a refugee claimant swears to the truth of certain allegations, a presumption is created that those allegations are true unless there are reasons to doubt their truthfulness.

The fact that until a few years ago most of the legal profession in Canada would have thought that claiming refugee status in a situation of spousal abuse was not possible, surely demonstrates the reasonableness of her explanation.

In his first revised narrative, the applicant alleged that he was attacked by three men, two of whom he recognized. At the hearing, the applicant alleged that it was three or four men, only one of whom he recognized. The Board noted that when questioned about these inconsistencies, the applicant responded that the events in Turkey had caused him great psychological harm and he could therefore not think clearly.

There is no other plausible purpose behind the submission of the False Document other than to mislead the immigration authorities into thinking that the file was complete and that the principal applicant had satisfied the language requirements. An official doing an initial completeness review of the file would not necessarily notice that it was fraudulent.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [94] As outlined above, this confuses the reasons for targeting with the risk itself ( <REFERENCE> , above, at para 13; <REFERENCE> , above, at para 29; <REFERENCE> , above, at para 29). The original motivation of the gang in targeting Mr. Correa (extortion) does not define his risk. Rather, the Board was obligated to look at his present risk in both nature and degree and determine if it is fundamentally the same or different from that faced by the population generally, or some significant sub-group. The fact that this risk may have stemmed from extortion is irrelevant, except to the extent that it helps to objectively assess the nature and degree of the risk. Mr. Correa faced a risk that he and his family would be killed because he had refused the gang's demands and reported them to police. Business owners faced a risk that they would be extorted. The general population faced a risk that various demands (on pain of violence) would be made of them by various gangs. These are not the same risks. As outlined above, determining whether a risk is the same requires consideration of both the nature and the degree of the risk ( <REFERENCE> , above, at para 8; <TARGETCASE> , above, at para 111; De La <REFERENCE> , at para 41).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [9] There has been general consensus in this Court that the standard of review applicable to citizenship judges' determinations of whether an applicant has met the residence requirement of the Act is reasonableness simpliciter ( Canada (Minister of Citizenship and <TARGETCASE> [ <REFERENCE> ] ; <REFERENCE> ). Following this jurisprudence and in light of the Supreme Court of Canada's recent decision in <REFERENCE> I regard the applicable standard of review as reasonableness. Section 5(1) of the Act sets out the necessary criteria for obtaining citizenship. Section 5(1)( c ) requires that a person should accumulate at least three years, or 1,095 days, of residence within the four years immediately preceding the date of his or her application for citizenship. Each applicant bears the onus of establishing the residence requirement on a balance of probabilities. ",The standard of review applicable to citizenship judges' determinations of whether an applicant has met the residence requirement of the Act is reasonableness simpliciter.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [31] There is very little jurisprudence with respect to the determination of damages for breach of privacy, particularly in the context of PIPEDA. One of the most comprehensive reviews of this matter is to be found in REFERENCE where my colleague Justice Zinn provided some helpful guidelines. Referring to the decision of the Supreme Court in TARGETCASE, Justice Zinn mentioned three rationales for awarding damages: compensation, deterrence and vindication. He then listed a number of non-exhaustive factors for determining whether damages should be awarded and the quantum of such damages: (i) Whether awarding damages would further the general objects of PIPEDA and uphold the values it embodies; (ii) Whether damages should be awarded for deterring future breaches; and (iii) The seriousness or egregiousness of the breach. REFERENCE ","Three rationales for awarding damages are compensation, deterrence, and vindication, and factors for determining whether damages should be awarded and the quantum of such damages include whether awarding damages would further the general objects of PIPEDA, whether damages should be awarded for deterring future breaches, and the seriousness or egregiousness of the breach."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [29] The applicants submit that the Board in the present case did not refer to or meet this test. With all due respect, this test resembles unequivocally the ""effective"" test which the case-law has not accepted, preferring the ""adequacy"" test (see also Minister of Citizenship and <TARGETCASE> ). ",The case-law prefers the 'adequacy' test over the 'effective' test.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [28] This Court has confirmed that an individual returning to a country where they fear persecution makes the existence of that fear unlikely ( <REFERENCE> CarswellNat 4335 at para 41). Regardless, it is also acknowledged that ""re-availment"" is not a temporary visit but requires an intention to permanently reside in that country before physical presence will negate refugee status ( <TARGETCASE> ","Re-availment"" requires an intention to permanently reside in a country before physical presence will negate refugee status."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [17] In the case at bar, Mr. Hemmati, when asked, provided several general answers concerning the practices of the Baha'i faith and claimed no knowledge of the religion's holy days or practises, as he had not been allowed to participate on those days. Considering this vague evidence, and the deference owed to the Board in this area, I cannot find any error in the Board's decision to draw an adverse inference on this point. <TARGETCASE> 3. Did the Board err in making an implausibility finding that the Applicant's parents would not have permitted the Applicant to attend Baha'i meetings? <REFERENCE> ",The Board is owed deference in drawing an adverse inference from vague evidence provided by an applicant about their religious practices.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: In assessing claims for protection under section 97 of the IRPA, the RPD is required to develop and exercise considerable expertise in connection with often difficult issues of fact, mixed fact and law, and ""the imperatives and nuances of the legislative regime"" ( <REFERENCE> , at para. 25). c. The nature of the question of that has been raised in the case at bar is not of ""central importance to the legal system ... and outside the ... specialized area of expertise"" of an immigration officer ( <REFERENCE> , emphasis added). In contrast to constitutional questions, true questions of jurisdiction, questions that are at the heart of the administration of justice and questions regarding the jurisdictional lines between two or more competing specialized tribunals ( <REFERENCE> , at paras. 58-61) , the interpretation and application of section 97 of the IRPA is a narrow legal exercise that arises solely in the highly specialized area of immigration and refugee law. Moreover, in this context, the interpretation of paragraph 97(1)(b)(ii) is ""clearly intertwined with the factual matrix in which [it] arise[s] "" ( <TARGETCASE> at para.","The interpretation and application of section 97 of the IRPA is a narrow legal exercise that arises solely in the highly specialized area of immigration and refugee law, and the interpretation of paragraph 97(1)(b)(ii) is clearly intertwined with the factual matrix in which it arises."

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [47] On summary judgment the moving party bears the legal onus of establishing the facts necessary to obtain summary judgment. The Minister has done so in this case. When that onus was met, the responding party, the Defendants, had the evidential burden of showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. Each side must put its best foot forward ( TARGETCASE). Here the evidence put forward by the Defendants did not meet their burden.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: Stated another way for clarity, the question to be answered is, would it be unduly harsh to expect this person, who is being persecuted in one part of his country, to move to another less hostile part of the country before seeking refugee status abroad? < REFERENCE> The Court of Appeal concluded: <REFERENCE> ""In conclusion, it is not a matter of a claimant's convenience or the attractiveness of the IFA, but whether one should be expected to make do in that location, before travelling halfway around the world to seek a safe haven, in another country. Thus, the objective standard of reasonableness which I have suggested for an IFA is the one that best conforms to the definition of Convention refugee. That definition requires claimants to be unable or unwilling by reason of fear of persecution to claim the protection of their home country in any part of that country. The prerequisites of that definition can only be met if it is not reasonable for the claimant to seek and obtain safety from persecution elsewhere in the country. < TARGETCASE>","The objective standard of reasonableness for an Internal Flight Alternative (IFA) requires claimants to be unable or unwilling by reason of fear of persecution to claim the protection of their home country in any part of that country, and it is not reasonable for the claimant to seek and obtain safety from persecution elsewhere in the country."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [11] The Minister argues that, in light of certain concerns, the citizenship judge should have required additional documentation instead of accepting Ms. Kettani's verbal statements. However, I note that a citizenship application does not require that all the evidence be corroborated (TARGETCASE; REFERENCE; REFERENCE). ",A citizenship application does not require that all the evidence be corroborated.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [64] In fact, Justice Dawson has dealt with this very point in <TARGETCASE> where she concluded as follows at paragraph 11: ""In view of this evidence, the Board engaged in speculation when it concluded that possibly hundreds of officials had to be bribed.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [43] The test applicable under section 96 is whether there is a serious possibility of persecution should the Applicant be returned to Colombia. This standard is lower than a balance of probabilities, but higher than a mere possibility ( <TARGETCASE> ). As such, the Applicant submits it was an error for the RPD to only apply the higher section 97 test to his claim, instead of the lower section 96 test. Section 97 ","The test under section 96 is whether there is a serious possibility of persecution, a standard lower than a balance of probabilities but higher than a mere possibility."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [3] <TARGETCASE> Division of the Federal Court of Canada, wrote at paragraph 8 of his reasons: …But where the motion for a stay is in relation to a refusal to defer removal, the fact of granting the stay gives the applicant that which the removal officer refused him/her. Since the decision in issue in the application for judicial review is the refusal to defer removal, granting the stay gives the applicant his/her remedy before the merits of the application for judicial review have been addressed. It is in this sense that one can say that the disposition of the motion for a stay of execution decides the underlying application for judicial review. I am satisfied that the foregoing brief quotation is dispositive of this application for judicial review on its particular facts. BACKGROUND ","Where the motion for a stay is in relation to a refusal to defer removal, granting the stay gives the applicant his/her remedy before the merits of the application for judicial review have been addressed."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [33] I t is improbable, however, that the Applicant's refugee claim would have succeeded even if the letters and the Applicant's sworn statement had been made available to the RPD. The RPD found that the Applicant had not been consistent on dates and locations of various significant events or the content of the telephone calls with the alleged extortionists, and that the Applicant's actions were not always consistent with his alleged subjective fear. To accept that he continued to be threatened by the Karuna group, the RPD would have had to conclude that he had already been threatened. This is not the case. As my colleague Justice Barnes stated in similar circumstances, <TARGETCASE> does not open ""the PRRA process to a re-examination of evidence that was already before the IRB or that could have been put to the IRB but was not. A PRRA is not an appeal from the IRB and it does not afford an opportunity to argue that the IRB misinterpreted the evidence before it"": <REFERENCE> [ <REFERENCE> ] at para 12.

There, the Supreme Court examined and analysed the existing jurisprudence then synthesized and articulated the principles applicable to patent construction.

",The Supreme Court held that claim construction is antecedent to issues of validity and infringement in patent law.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [90] Since paragraph 18.1(4)( c ) does not use deferential language as in paragraph 18.1(4)( d ) of the <TARGETCASE> , it had been advocated with respect to an ""error of law"" that, ""the necessary implication is that where Parliament did not provide for deferential review, it intended the reviewing court to apply a correctness standard as it does in the regular appellate context"". However, this minority view notably endorsed by Justice Rothstein has been dismissed by the majority of the Supreme Court in <REFERENCE> . In sum, the nature of the question is not necessarily determinative, deference being generally given to issues of law coming within the ambit of the reviewed tribunal mandate and specialized expertise ( <REFERENCE> and <REFERENCE> , above). ","Where Parliament did not provide for deferential review, it intended the reviewing court to apply a correctness standard as it does in the regular appellate context."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [29] Furthermore, the ID did expressly consider the Amnesty International report, which suggested that Mr. Muyongo did not lead the group responsible for the attack. The ID weighed this report against other evidence that suggested Mr. Muyongo did lead the group responsible for the attack, and found the latter evidence more credible. This credibility finding was open to the ID, considering the low evidentiary threshold for establishing inadmissibility on security grounds. <TARGETCASE> ",The low evidentiary threshold for establishing inadmissibility on security grounds allows for credibility findings.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [28] This is precisely what Justice Marc Nadon (now of the Court of Appeal) did in <REFERENCE> . In Chen , Justice Nadon was faced with the question of which was the correct test for a citizenship judge to apply. He held that it was Pourgahsemi and rejected both Papadogiorgakis and Koo Re as not being correct tests, noting: <REFERENCE> That provision exacts that the applicant must have ""within the four years immediately preceding the date of his application, accumulated at least three years of residence in Canada ..."" Parliament introduces an element of emphasis into the statutory text by enacting ""... at least three years of residence in Canada ..."" Those emphasized words are unnecessary, except for emphasis. The appellant accumulated less than one year, before the date of his application for citizenship. In drawing a purposive interpretation of the statutory language it should be asked: Why did Parliament prescribe at least 3 years of Canadian residence in the 4 years immediately before applying for citizenship? <REFERENCE> It is clear that the purpose of s. 5(1)(c) [of the Act ] is to insure that everyone who is granted precious Canadian citizenship has become, or at least has been compulsorily presented with the everyday opportunity to become, ""Canadianized"". <TARGETCASE> ","The purpose of s. 5(1)(c) of the Act is to ensure that everyone granted Canadian citizenship has had the opportunity to become ""Canadianized""."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [22] The Supreme Court <REFERENCE> at paragraph 48 endorsed the view that, when reviewing a decision on the reasonableness standard, a court must pay ""respectful attention to the reasons offered or which could have been offered in support of a decision."" Mr. Justice Evans in a dissenting decision in <REFERENCE> (subsequently adopted by the Supreme Court of Canada, in <REFERENCE> ) confirmed the above view. He wrote at paragraph 164 of his reasons: <REFERENCE> The underlined words avoid an unduly formalistic approach to judicial review. Thus, to the extent that the Tribunal does not fully explain aspects of its decision, the Court may consult evidence referred to by the Tribunal in order to flesh out its reasons. However, I do not regard the Court <REFERENCE> as inviting a reviewing court to usurp the tribunal's responsibility for justifying its decisions. <TARGETCASE> ","If the Tribunal does not fully explain aspects of its decision, the Court may consult evidence referred to by the Tribunal in order to flesh out its reasons, but it should not usurp the tribunal's responsibility for justifying its decisions."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [68] I am more convinced by Mr. Addo’s argument about Rule 82. The Rule is quite explicit, and it has been interpreted strictly by this <TARGETCASE> . It is also clear from the jurisprudence that this Court considers it a violation of Rule 82 when lawyers from the same representative law firm submit an affidavit, then argue the case to which the affidavit relates ( <REFERENCE> , above).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [33] An applicant seeking a Charter remedy must prove, on a balance of probabilities, that a Charter violation has occurred. To establish a breach of his section 7 rights under the Charter, the Applicant must demonstrate that there has been a denial of his liberty and security of the person by Canadian officials and that this deprivation is not in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice ( <TARGETCASE> at paragraphs 21-22). The Applicant has not provided any evidence that there has been a Charter violation by Canadian officials.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [24] The Officer, instead of avoiding a determination of risk, appears to have plunged into a risk analysis and concluded, contrary to the findings of the Refugee Protection Division, that there was personalized risk to the Applicant. I repeat part of what Applicant's Counsel wrote in her Memorandum of Argument: <REFERENCE> 12. The Applicant submits that the Immigration Officer made these findings in order to preclude herself from having to undertake a hardship analysis based on the country conditions present in Turkey. <REFERENCE> 13. What the Immigration Officer is stating is that the Applicant is a person who will face such high degrees of discrimination that it amounts to persecution, but refuses to determine whether someone in such a position might also face significant degree of hardship. <REFERENCE> 14. Said another way, the Immigration Officer is stating that a person who is discriminated against ""a little"" will have their H&C case considered. Whereas a person who is discriminated against ""a lot"", as was found in this case, will not have their case reviewed.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [243] Based on the questions proposed for certification by the applicants and the respondent's reply, I would certify the following questions which I believe pass the test articulated by the Court of Appeal in <TARGETCASE> ; 176 N.R. 4 (F.C.A.): 1. Does Guideline 7, issued under the authority of the Chairperson of the Immigration and Refugee Board, violate the principles of fundamental justice under s. 7 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms by unduly interfering with claimants' right to be heard and right to counsel? 2. Does the implementation of paragraphs 19 and 23 of the Chairperson's Guideline 7 violate principles of natural justice? 3. Has the implementation of Guideline 7 led to fettering of Refugee Protection Division Members' discretion? 4. Does a finding that Guideline 7 fetters a Refugee Protection Division Member's discretion necessarily mean that the application for judicial review must be granted, without regard to whether or not the applicant was otherwise afforded procedural fairness in the particular case or whether there was an alternate basis for rejecting the claim?","Questions for certification pass the test if they concern whether a guideline violates principles of fundamental justice, natural justice, or fetters discretion, and whether a finding of fettering discretion necessitates granting an application for judicial review."
question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [41] It is quite proper for the Refugee Division to take the plaintiff's actions into account in assessing his subjective fear. It is reasonable for it to conclude that the fact he returned to the country where he feared persecution makes the existence of such a fear unlikely (see <TARGETCASE> (T.D.)). ,The fact that a plaintiff returned to the country where he feared persecution makes the existence of such a fear unlikely.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [22] Turning to the third issue canvassed in the case law, several cases have upheld RPD findings in situations like the present case where the RPD premised its decision in large part on the claimants being members of a ""particular social group"" comprised of Tamils who were at risk as a result of their presence on one of the vessels but also commented at one place or another in the decision that the risk in question was tied to the claimants' ethnicity and the possibility that they might be viewed as supporters of the LTTE. In <REFERENCE> , <REFERENCE> , <REFERENCE> , <REFERENCE> and <TARGETCASE> , Justices O'Reilly, Blanchard, Noël and de Montigny upheld the decisions reached by the RPD on the basis of there being a confluence of grounds related to race and perceived political opinion, which they found to be sufficient to establish a nexus to one of the grounds in the Refugee Convention .","There can be a confluence of grounds related to race and perceived political opinion, sufficient to establish a nexus to one of the grounds in the Refugee Convention."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [37] Rather it is the view of the consumer which is important in law and it necessarily follows that the correct consumer must be surveyed. In this case a survey of people who visited a ""McBeans"" outlet would have constituted a proper survey. As noted by MacKay, J., in Joseph E. Seagram & Sons Ltd. , supra, at p. 472: <TARGETCASE> ""The affidavits of the persons who actually conducted the interviews were not offered as evidence by the appellants. The affidavits of Mr. Mayer and Mr. Robertson are of little assistance in determining how representative the results of this survey actually are since they were not present while it was being conducted. Here there was no affidavit from anyone actually involved in the survey's completion, and no direct evidence of the manner in which questionnaires were completed or the accuracy of the completed returns. It is true they attest that the survey was conducted by trained questioners, and those surveyed were limited to a cohort, chosen at random, of those over 21 years and who were permanent or seasonal residents of the area.",The affidavits of the persons who actually conducted the interviews must be offered as evidence to determine how representative the results of a survey are.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [32] Practically speaking, a finding of implausibility is simply an element or rationale for explaining an overall finding that an applicant lacks credibility or reliability.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [27] However, the RPD may make a reviewable error if it fails to mention and analyse important evidence that points away from its own conclusions, as the Court infers from this silence that the RPD has made erroneous findings without regard to the evidence before it (REFERENCE; TARGETCASE; REFERENCE).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [16] Therefore, the issue is whether Prothonotary Morneau, in finding that Bard's representative need not answer the questions at issue in this appeal, exercised his discretion based upon a wrong principle or upon a misapprehension of the facts. If he did not, then his decision attracts considerable deference and should only be interfered with ""in the clearest case of misuse of judicial discretion"" ( NOV <REFERENCE> at para 14; <REFERENCE> , at para 11). This is particularly the case where, as here, the impugned decision was rendered in the context of case management. In such context, it is generally recognized that the burden of a party seeking to overturn an interlocutory order by a case-manager is a heavy one as a casemanager is normally intimately familiar with the history, details, and complexities of the casemanaged matter ( Sanofi- <TARGETCASE> at para 15).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [35] Meanwhile, the respondent argues that both <REFERENCE> and <REFERENCE> do not apply to the case at bar. Neither applicant in these two cases was prohibited by statute from becoming Canadian citizen. Considering the applicant is statute-barred from swearing the oath and ineligible to become a citizen on account of his conviction, there is no present duty owed by the Minister to the applicant, and so this Court cannot compel the authority to perform it ( <TARGETCASE> [ <REFERENCE> ]).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [35] Also, boards are presumed to have considered all the evidence ( Florea at paragraph 1). Sometimes, when a probative piece of evidence that is contrary to a board's conclusions is not mentioned, the Court will draw an inference that the board overlooked it (see <TARGETCASE> (QL) at paragraphs 15 to 17, 157 FTR 35). <REFERENCE> ","When a probative piece of evidence that is contrary to a board's conclusions is not mentioned, the Court will draw an inference that the board overlooked it."

Paragraph 40(1)( a ) of the IRPA states that a foreign national will be inadmissible if they directly or indirectly misrepresent or withhold material facts relating to a relevant matter that induces or that could induce an error in the administration of the IRPA.

The Applicants add that ""Meds"" refers to medical assessments, and that section 23.8 of OP5 states that ""[t]he medical assessments will be initiated and coordinated by the visa office immediately following a positive decision to process the application.""

Mr. Corona took steps with the Consulate of Mexico in Montréal to obtain a copy of his complaint. However, he fails to explain why he was unable to obtain a copy from his employer.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [31] Of course, the mere use of the words ""will"" or ""would"" is not, in and of itself, sufficient to conclude that the officer applied the wrong legal test, especially if this is an isolated occurrence. Regard must be had to the decision as a whole, as this Court has made clear on a number of occasions: see, for example, <REFERENCE> . On the other hand, the mere recital at the very end of an assessment of a standard formula with respect to the correct threshold will not cure the deficiencies found elsewhere in the reasons. The present case seems to me to be borderline. If the officer had made no other reviewable error, I do not think this would be sufficient to quash her decision. But it adds to the other problems found with her decision and, cumulatively, they most certainly warrant a new PRRA. <REFERENCE> C) The assessment of the evidence <TARGETCASE> ","The mere use of the words 'will' or 'would' is not sufficient to conclude that the officer applied the wrong legal test, and the mere recital of a standard formula with respect to the correct threshold will not cure the deficiencies found elsewhere in the reasons."

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [23] This presumption is particularly strong in the case of democracies. That said, there is a wide spectrum of democratic nations, and so the Board must look further than the mere existence of elections, which are less important for the issue of state protection, but focus on the strength of the institutions relevant to state protection, such as the professionalism of the police force and the independence of the judiciary and defence bar: <TARGETCASE> .

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [19] In <TARGETCASE> , the applicant claimed to have suffered a severe blow during military service which later manifested itself in an ailment complained of many years after. The applicant there presented the following medical evidence from a Dr. McKenna: ""[The patient] wonders if, in fact, such a severe blow to the head could damage his neck and set up a tendency to develop cervical disc disease at a relatively early age of 48. I feel this is possible because the blow on the head was sufficient to knock him unconscious. It would certainly have some repercussions and transmittance of force to the neck as well, and I would think there is a link in this area, i.e. the blow may have contributed to the cervical disc degeneration and the symptoms of brachialgia which he has been getting in his upper limbs."" The Board, in responding to this evidence, did not deny that the earlier blow took place, but wrote: ""[The Board] finds that Dr. McKenna's medical opinion is predicated on the appellant having sustained a severe injury in 1966.",A severe blow to the head during military service can potentially contribute to the development of cervical disc disease at a relatively early age.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [72] When discussing the case law summarized <REFERENCE> -La <TARGETCASE> , Justice Karen Sharlow in Wyeth noted, at paragraph 26, the use in a number of decisions of the adjective ""substantive"" to describe the type of SNDS that could support a listing. She said that this had to be understood to mean ""substantive in relation to the patented invention or the patent claims"" (see also paragraph 47). Up until then, the Court understands that the analysis of the nature of the SNDS was carried out to determine if the SNDS fell within the meaning of subsection 4(1), such that a patent list could be submitted against it for registration. In contrast, the concept of ""relevance of the patent"" commented upon in <REFERENCE> and discussed at paragraph 22 of Justice Hughes' decision in Wyeth appears to be directed to a linkage between a patent and an NOC, as required by subsection 4(5) and 5(1) of the former NOC Regulations . ","Substantive"" in relation to a Supplementary New Drug Submission (SNDS) means it is substantive in relation to the patented invention or the patent claims, and this is used to determine if the SNDS falls within the meaning of subsection 4(1), such that a patent list could be submitted against it for registration."

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [137] As for the literature relied upon by Dr. Brittain that was not cited in Mylan's NOA, counsel for Lilly was unable to provide any case law to support its view that every single document upon which Mylan intended to rely to substantiate its allegations must be disclosed in its NOA. The only decision that I was referred to was TARGETCASE, where the Federal Court of Appeal did strike the second person's evidence as it related to prior art not cited in the NOA. That determination, however, turned upon its facts. I agree with Prothonotary Tabib that the ratio decidendi of that case is not that a second person is precluded from relying on any document not cited in the NOA, but rather that the second person may not rely on any facts not cited in the NOA: see REFERENCE.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [34] A careful review of the case law on disclosure leads me to the conclusion that this is much too broad a proposition. One must never loose sight of the fact that the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Board is an administrative tribunal with specialized knowledge, not bound by legal or technical rules of evidence. As a result, the disclosure standards delineated <REFERENCE> do not necessarily apply automatically in the context of a refugee hearing and may require some adaptation. On the other hand, I agree with the applicant that the level of disclosure owed to an applicant cannot be decided by a simple invocation of the distinction between criminal and administrative proceedings, and that the consequences of an adverse finding on the applicant must be taken into consideration.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: The overriding consideration is the intention of the legislature: did it intend that a reviewing court accord the decision under review deference, or was a full right of appeal intended, or does the relevant standard fall somewhere on the spectrum that lies between these two poles. Also, the standard of review must be determined by reference to the specific nature of the decision under review. The same standard will not necessarily apply to all decisions of the same decision-maker. The factors to be assessed according to Pushpanathan are: (1) the legislative provisions governing the review process, including whether there is a privative clause; (2) the degree of expertise of the tribunal with respect to the question in issue, as compared to the degree of expertise the reviewing court has on that subject; (3) the purpose of the legislation and the nature of the decision-maker; that is, whether the decision-maker is balancing public policy considerations (sometimes vaguely worded) as opposed to adjudicating the rights of individuals; (4) the nature of the decision under review, including whether it is a question of law or a question of fact. < TARGETCASE>","The standard of review must be determined by the specific nature of the decision under review, considering factors such as legislative provisions, the expertise of the tribunal versus the reviewing court, the purpose of the legislation and the nature of the decision-maker, and the nature of the decision under review."

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [25] The Immigration Officer's decision gave no indication as to the grounds for its conclusion. HW's purported M5 assessment of December 1990 was inconsistent with the assessments of M7 and T5 included in the 1988 Medical Notification. The M5 assessment states that future admission to Canada could be considered because of the ""expected response to treatment"".

However, A&N argue, compellingly in my view, that the evidence of GWI's own experts revealed that the alleged parent/subsidiary relationship was too attenuated in this case to support the finding of an implied licence. Evidence was given in respect to the coporate relationship by Simon Bicknell, Assistant Group Secretary and Assistant Secretary of Glaxo Wellcome plc, Suzanne Gagnon, Vice-President Corporate Affairs of Glaxo Wellcome Inc., and Laurence D. Jenkins, formerly Deputy Head of Group Patents and Agreements of the Wellcome Foundation, and presently Deputy Manager of Global Intellectual Property for Glaxo Wellcome plc. In fact, Wellcome Foundation Ltd. indirectly owns only 13.2% of GWI. Notwithstanding that these experts gave highly detailed accounts of the corporate relations as between GWI, the Wellcome Foundation Ltd., Glaxo Group Ltd. and Glaxo Wellcome plc and thus attempted to assert an indirect relationship of parent and subsidiary, I cannot accept that so low a percentage of ownership could establish the Wellcome Foundation Ltd. and GWI as parent and subsidiary under Canadian law.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [12] Since that decision, which was based in part on earlier decisions of the Court of Appeal, a number of my colleagues have commented on the matter and the weight of decisions now may be said to consider change in light of at least some of the criteria proposed by Professor Hathaway. At the very least the decisions of the Court of Appeal in <REFERENCE> (F.C.A.) and <REFERENCE> (F.C.A.), both decided after the decision of Mr. Justice Dubé <REFERENCE> - <REFERENCE> , make clear that the change must be ""meaningful and effective enough to render the genuine fear of the appellant unreasonable and hence without foundation"", per Mr. Justice Marceau in Cuadra , supra, or ""meaningful and effective change which is required to expunge the objective foundation of the appellant's claim"", per Mr. Justice Marceau in Ahmed , supra. <REFERENCE> , my colleague Mr. Justice Nadon specifically disagreed with his reading of the decision of McKeown, J., in <TARGETCASE> (T.D.) and my own earlier reasons in <REFERENCE> were similar to those in respect of this matter, and he effectively adopts the test outlined by <REFERENCE> ] (T.D.))",The change must be 'meaningful and effective enough to render the genuine fear of the appellant unreasonable and hence without foundation' or 'meaningful and effective change which is required to expunge the objective foundation of the appellant's claim'.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [53] Furthermore, the Tribunal was correct in stating that REFERENCE REFERENCE. In TARGETCASE , above, the Supreme Court made it clear that the emphasis must be on the magnitude of the prejudice and not on the impossibility to answer each and every allegation of a complaint. Where, as here, key witnesses have vague independent recollection of the relevant incidents, the potential defence to the allegations is contingent to a large extent on these testimonies, and the delay is extensive, it is certainly not unreasonable to find the prejudice to be so serious as to impair the NRC's ability effectively to defend itself.

question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [23] The applicant also argued that the IAD erred in concluding that he did not meet the residency requirement in section 28 of the IRPA even though he produced substantial documentation regarding his criminal record in Canada establishing his continuous physical presence in Canada during the material time in question. But a careful examination of the documentation furnished by the applicant in relation to his criminal record in Canada reveals that it is not dispositive of the question of whether he physically resided in Canada during the requisite period of time. <TARGETCASE> ,Documentation of a criminal record in Canada is not dispositive of the question of whether one physically resided in Canada during the requisite period of time.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [9] I disagree with the Applicant's argument and particularly with his understanding of the <TARGETCASE> test. In my view, Mr. Justice O'Reilly was clear. He stated that an applicant must first show that he has established residence in Canada, and then demonstrate that they maintained residence for the required duration. It follows, that a citizenship judge must first determine the point of time when an applicant has established residence in Canada, since that date is not necessarily the date of landing. Here, that date was determined to be October 2, 2002. The Citizenship Judge explained his finding as follows: Immediately after landing in Canada you commenced months of foreign travel. After landing on 07 April 2001 you left Canada nine days later on 16 April 2001, returning 09 July 2001 for four weeks in Ottawa while your parents looked for accommodation there.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [20] The applicant acknowledged that the Board is not obliged to refer to every piece of evidence before it, but submitted that when the evidence that the Board fails to address is significant or central to the applicant's claim, it commits a patently unreasonable error or law ( <REFERENCE> (T.D.) (QL)). The applicant submitted that the Board's analysis of objective documentary evidence is extremely brief and comprises only two short paragraphs. The applicant further submitted that the Board's review of the documentary evidence focuses on the criminality of homosexuality in Sri Lanka and fails to mention that gay men are often assaulted, as well as targeted by the police. The applicant drew the Court's attention to the case of <REFERENCE> wherein Justice Mactavish considered a case with a very similar set of issues. The Court in <TARGETCASE> above, held that while it is open to the Board to weigh the documentary evidence and reject it, given the importance of the evidence to a central issue in this case, it was not open to the Board to simply ignore it. The applicant submitted that the Board had clear evidence before it on the treatment of individuals similarly-situated to the applicant, and failed to mention this evidence in its reasons. The applicant submitted that this failure resulted in an error of law.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [43] This is significant because, had the Board not also erred in concluding that the FARC was only interested in Ms. Villegas' brothers, there was evidence which could have reasonably led the Board to conclude either that: (i) she had personally been persecuted; or (ii) she was a member of a social group, namely, her family, that was persecuted, and that she had a sufficient nexus to that persecution as to warrant refugee protection ( <TARGETCASE> ). <REFERENCE> ","If a person has been personally persecuted or is a member of a persecuted social group, such as their family, and has a sufficient nexus to that persecution, they may warrant refugee protection."

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [4] The IRB gave several reasons for its finding that the applicant's story was not credible. The panel noted, inter alia, the inconsistency between the applicant's allegation that she fears her father and the information contained in the Certificate of Registration in the birth registry, the applicant's failure to mention her fear of Mr. Banda at the port of entry, and the implausibility of the applicant's statements regarding the financial resources which enabled her to travel to Canada. A review of the file indicates that the applicant's explanations on this point were simply found to be inadequate. <TARGETCASE> , the Federal Court of Appeal held that a tribunal's perception that the applicant is not credible on an important aspect of the claim can amount to a finding that there is no credible evidence on which the claim can be based. The panel was therefore justified in relying on these inconsistencies, omissions and implausibilities to determine that the applicant was not credible with regard to her subjective fear.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [23] With respect, I think this case and others to which I drew counsel's attention at the hearing of this matter (for example <TARGETCASE> , in which eight years elapsed between the date of the complaint and the time it was brought on for hearing before a Tribunal) illustrate that the Commission seems to have lost sight of the importance of timeliness in resolving complaints brought to it. In this case, the Commission, after expressing its dissatisfaction with the 1985 agreement, decided not to dismiss the 1982 complaint. It kept the complaint alive but did not take any active steps to require the parties to bring it to a resolution. In 1991, even though the pay equity issue had not been resolved, it decided to dismiss the complaint. The 1992/1993 complaint has bogged down on a motion to dismiss at an early stage. It took the Commission almost two years to merely decide to deal with the complaint. There has not been any investigation. If after investigation the complaint is referred to a tribunal for resolution, it is not difficult to envisage a further two or three years being occupied in the investigation and tribunal processes. The question is begged as to why the Commission did not efficiently monitor the parties' progress under their 1985 agreement with effective case management or deal with the matter itself when it concluded that progress was unsatisfactory. Now the Commission has failed to move the 1992/1993 complaint forward in a timely manner. <REFERENCE> ",The Commission should ensure timeliness in resolving complaints brought to it and efficiently monitor the parties' progress with effective case management.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [37] The Applicant has referred to <TARGETCASE> F.T.R. 136, but I have not found this case to be persuasive in the present case. In <REFERENCE> , the Court noted that there was absolutely no reference to hardship in the decision of the Officer, only to personalized risk, and thus the Officer applied the wrong test by assessing risk as opposed to hardship. In the case at bar, however, the Officer refers to hardship a number of times and indicates clearly that his discussion regarding state protection was not determinative and was only included as part of an analysis of unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship. Did the Officer err by incorrectly finding that the applicable removal order against the Applicants is a one-year exclusion order?

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [62] Subsection 6(2) of the Act refers to the use of competing trade-marks in the same area in association with comparable wares or services. At the hearing, counsel for the respondent referred to a hypothetical scenario of confusion in light of the resemblance between the trade-marks. I find his argument to be meritorious after having fully considered the matter. There would be a likelihood of confusion in a situation where the respondent's brand of hotels and that of the applicant were to both construct and operate properties on the waterfront of an Ontario lake. In this scenario it would not be difficult for the first impression of a casual consumer somewhat in a hurry to confuse the two hotels, either while booking online or while passing by in person ( REFERENCE). A confusion analysis in the hypothetical occurrence of geographical proximity is considered by the Supreme Court in TARGETCASEand the potentiality of confusion is accepted without any need of documented proof (see also REFERENCE and REFERENCE).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [15] On October 6, 2009, Mr. Mahjoub was provided with a redacted version of the Risk Assessment. Justice Layden-Stevenson had urged the CBSA to conduct such a personalized risk assessment of Mr. Mahjoub in the previous review of conditions of release ( Mahjoub 4 ). She stated at paragraph 126 of her reasons: ""[A]n individualized risk assessment regarding Mr. Mahjoub should be conducted forthwith. Justice Mosley's factual findings [ <TARGETCASE> 3 ], combined with the Charkaoui 1 factors, demand no less."" I note that at the time the Risk Assessment was ordered Mr. Mahjoub was not in detention. Mr. Mahjoub had initially requested that a witness be produced by the Ministers for the purpose of cross-examination on the Risk Assessment during this detention review. The Ministers advised that the author of the Risk Assessment was unavailable at the time he was initially required to attend. Even though the schedule of the hearing was extended beyond the initial period during which the witness was said to be unavailable, the witness was not produced. Instead, the Ministers informed the Court that they would not be relying on the Risk Assessment for the purposes of this detention review. ",An individualized risk assessment regarding Mr. Mahjoub should be conducted forthwith.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [9] In addition, the court has an implied or inherent jurisdiction, not in the sense of a substantive jurisdiction, but rather of an inherent procedural jurisdiction to control its own process, notwithstanding its rules and limiting statutory jurisdiction: see for example <TARGETCASE> (F.C.A.), at p. 26 and following. As Mr. Justice Addy put it, in <REFERENCE> (T.D.), at p. 301, ""... every court of superior jurisdiction ... must possess the innate right of controlling its own process and, subject to the requirements of justice, to control the actions before it of those wishing to avail themselves of its jurisdiction."". Similarly, ""... this court has an inherent jurisdiction over its own process to enable it to carry out the basic raison d'être it shares with every court of civil jurisdiction: ..."": <REFERENCE> (T.D.), at p. 402.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [52] The function and the purpose of a trademark is to indicate the source of the goods. A trademark by definition must be and remain distinctive of a single source. In Molson Breweries, A <REFERENCE> C.P.R.(3d) 481 (T.D.), Dubé, J., stated that distinctiveness requires that: 1. a mark and a product be associated; 2. the owner uses this association between the mark and its product and is manufacturing and selling this product; and 3. this association enables the owner to distinguish its product from that of others ( <TARGETCASE> inherent distinctiveness and acquired distinctiveness. A mark is distinctive when nothing about it refers the customers to a multitude of sources. Consequently, when a mark is a unique or invented name, such that it could only refer to one thing, it is possible to conclude that it is inherently distinctive. When a trademark does not have inherent distinctiveness, it may still acquire distinctiveness through continual use in the marketplace. However, to establish that distinctiveness has been acquired, it must be shown that the mark has become known to consumers as originating from one particular source. ","A mark is distinctive when it refers customers to a single source and can be inherently distinctive if it is a unique or invented name. If not inherently distinctive, a trademark may acquire distinctiveness through continual use in the marketplace, provided it becomes known to consumers as originating from one particular source."

In Tonner at p. 160, I came to a similar conclusion on the need for the VAB to always keep in mind its statutory duties and the broad principles informing the allowance of veterans' pensions. ""The Board gave consideration to the evidence always bearing in mind its statutory obligations pursuant to s. 3 and s. 10(5) of the VAB Act (emphasis added).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [41] That said, the applicant nevertheless argues that the dicta in <REFERENCE> , supra, concerning the removal of a permanent resident from Canada has been eroded by more recent pronouncements by the Supreme Court. The applicant notes in this regard that in <TARGETCASE> , supra, Sopinka, J., relied largely on the decisions of La Forest, J., and McLachlin, J. (as she then was), in <REFERENCE> C.C.C.(3d) 1; 8 C.R.(4th) 1. The applicant argues that both of these decisions relied on a contextual approach to a consideration of s. 7 fundamental justice. Although reference was made to a balancing of interests, clearly the contextual approach, involving a historical analysis of the process at issue and the government interest in that case extradition, was preferred. The applicant further submits that by the time the Supreme Court considered the appeal in <REFERENCE> B.C.A.C. 1; 243 W.A.C. 1, the principle that fundamental justice in s. 7 requires a fair balancing between state and personal interests was confirmed by the Supreme Court in <REFERENCE> O.A.C. 243.",The principle that fundamental justice in s. 7 requires a fair balancing between state and personal interests was confirmed by the Supreme Court.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: To allow a question, requiring the witness to select facts upon which he or she relies in order to support a given allegation, is to try to evade this fundamental rule by requiring the witness to consider the applicable law, then use it to select facts and to announce a result."" 3) It can sometimes be a little difficult to distinguish between fact and law. Since Rule 240 provides that factual questions must be answered, provided they are relevant, and since relevance is wider in discovery than at trial ( <TARGETCASE> (T.D.)), Justice Reed in <REFERENCE> , supra, found that where the factual component was more important, the question had to be answered: ""The Federal Court of Appeal has made it plain that when the evidence sought is the subject-matter of expert opinion, evidence to be disclosed pursuant to Rule 482, questions relating thereto are not required to be answered on discovery.","Relevance is wider in discovery than at trial and where the factual component is more important, the question must be answered, even if the evidence sought is the subject-matter of expert opinion."

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [20] The applicant is no doubt correct in stating that a state's ability to protect its citizens must be assessed not only by looking at the legislative and procedural framework in place, but also the capacity and the will to effectively implement that framework: see, for ex. <TARGETCASE> Imm.

It is a reality of modern-day life that protection offered is sometimes ineffective. Many incidents of harassment and/or discrimination can be effected in a manner that renders effective investigation and protection very difficult. The use of unsigned correspondence that does not identify its source and of random telephone communications where the caller does not identify himself or herself are examples.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [23] This memorandum was also referred to in <TARGETCASE> (T.D.). I respectfully adopt the comments of Reed, J., from paragraph 6 of the decision in that case: ""... it may be an error to state that 'is usually required' means that the educational requirement must be met , except where there are significant and substantial factors that persuade the visa officer that the occupational requirements can be overcome .

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [32] The Applicants rely on <TARGETCASE> [ <REFERENCE> ] to support their argument. They say that an officer must take into consideration the status and likelihood of success of an applicant's outstanding sponsorship application.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [28] The Applicant argues that his evidence establishes that he is a specialist physician with extensive experience in Canada and Saudi Arabia and that he satisfies the requirements in MI-3 and the NOC document. According to the Applicant, the NOC document does not entail duties that would not be performed by someone with his particular specialized training and work experience. <TARGETCASE> the Applicant argues that the NOC document does not refer to ""duties other than those which are usually performed by general practitioners or specialist physicians all over the world, that is, making diagnoses and treating their patients, ordering laboratory tests or other diagnostic procedures, prescribing medication, acting as a consultant for other physicians or occasionally conducting research"" (at para 36).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [7] The appeal before the IAD is a hearing de novo in the broadest sense ( <REFERENCE> ). Accordingly, the applicant and the sponsoree bear the onus of proving, on a balance of probabilities, that the sponsored spouse is not excluded under section 4 of the Regulations. The determination of whether a marriage is bona fide therefore involves findings of fact and the sorting and weighing of evidence. Furthermore, the IAD is assumed to have considered all of the evidence presented to it in coming to its decision and its decision must be interpreted as a whole ( <REFERENCE> at para. 18; <REFERENCE> at para. 90 (F.C.A.), 253 D.L.R.

In a recent decision, <TARGETCASE> in the context of a variation decision by the ID, I noted that there was some support for this proposition in the jurisprudence.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [13] Nonetheless, the Prothonotary did not grant the motion to re-amend, and as I have said at the outset, I do not consider that decision unreasonable. However this Court has always held that amendments to add new causes of action are vital, and so I must exercise my discretion de novo . As stated by Mr. Justice Décary in <REFERENCE> , above, at paragraph 25: When is an amendment a routine one as opposed to a vital one? It would be imprudent to attempt any kind of formal categorization. It is much preferable to determine the point on a case by case basis (see <REFERENCE> per O'Keefe J. at para. 7, aff'd 2003 FCA 428). I note that amendments that would advance additional claims or causes of action have consistently been found, in the Federal Court of Canada, to be vital for the purposes of the Aqua-Gem test (see <TARGETCASE> (Snider J.). ",Amendments that would advance additional claims or causes of action have consistently been found to be vital for the purposes of the Aqua-Gem test.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [21] It is by now well established that the duty of fairness, even if it is at the low end of the spectrum in the context of visa applications ( <TARGETCASE> (F.C.) at para 39), require visa officers to inform applicants of their concerns so that an applicant may have an opportunity to disabuse an officer of such concerns. This will be the case, in particular, where such concern arises not so much from the legal requirements but from the authenticity or credibility of the evidence provided by the applicant . After having extensively reviewed the case law on this issue, Justice Mosley was able to reconcile the apparently contradictory findings of this Court in the following way: Having reviewed the factual context of the cases cited above, it is clear that where a concern arises directly from the requirements of the legislation or related regulations, a visa officer will not be under a duty to provide an opportunity for the applicant to address his or her concerns. Where however the issue is not one that arises in this context, such a duty may arise. This is often the case where the credibility, accuracy or genuine nature of information submitted by the applicant in support of their application is the basis of the visa officer's concern , as was the case in Rukmangathan , and in John and Cornea cited by the Court in Rukmangathan , above. <REFERENCE> (FC). [Emphasis added.] ","The duty of fairness requires visa officers to inform applicants of their concerns, particularly when these concerns arise from the authenticity or credibility of the evidence provided by the applicant, not from the legal requirements."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [10] The proper test is that of reasonable chance or good grounds that persecution will occur, not a balance of probabilities test: <TARGETCASE> visa officer sworn in December 2004, some 17 months after the decision was made, in which she attests that, as a result of her training, she was ""well aware that the applicant was required to show a 'reasonable chance' of persecution."" The respondent concedes that if this was a review of a Refugee Protection Division decision, the argument that the decision-maker erred in law would have serious merit. However, the respondent submits that the visa officer cited the appropriate statutory provisions and that the affidavit indicates that the officer was aware of the appropriate standard of proof. ","The proper test for persecution is that of reasonable chance or good grounds, not a balance of probabilities test."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [104] The same test was applied in similar circumstances in various judgments of this Court, and, in most of those cases, the nature of the information contained in the undisclosed documents and the influence they had on the decision-maker were the determinative factors (REFERENCE; REFERENCE; REFERENCE; REFERENCE; REFERENCE; REFERENCE; TARGETCASE).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [12] The moving parties tried to argue that they could not appeal the Board's ruling because they were not yet a party to the hearing before the Board. That argument does not seem convincing to me. Even if the moving parties have not yet requested and obtained authorization to participate in the hearing before the Board, the fact remains that they are at the heart of the Board's ruling dated January 6, 2015. As such, the moving parties qualify as parties to the proceeding for which they seek appellate review. In any event, there appears to be no doubt that the moving parties could file an application for judicial review if they had no right of appeal: TARGETCASE. Even though the Federal Court was given broad discretion with respect to the relief it could grant (FCA, section 44), it would still require jurisdiction regarding the individual or the organization against whom or which the relief is sought.

The Board's negative credibility finding was central to its decision. <REFERENCE> I accept the psychologist's opinion that the claimant suffers from ""chronic posttraumatic stress disorder"". However, given my finding that the claimant lacks credibility respecting the central elements of his refugee protection claim and based upon the documentary evidence before me, I find that this psychological dysfunction is not related to the claimant's alleged past mistreatment at the hand of Sunni Muslims, Turkish nationalists and the Turkish police or security forces, and as such this Psychological Assessment does not assist the claimant in his refugee protection claim.

While the Board is required by statute to draw every reasonable inference in favour of the applicant, this statutory duty does not raise a mere possibility to the level of established fact.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [41] Despite having concluded that the Board's decision, with respect to inclusion under sections 96 and 97 of the IRPA is not reviewable, I will continue to consider the question of exclusion. This is because, as the Federal Court of Appeal pointed out in <TARGETCASE> , above at paras. 1 to 3, the determination that a person is excluded as a Convention refugee under article 1F(b) has impacts beyond sections 96 and 97 of the IRPA . It means, for instance, that the person can not receive refugee protection under section 95 of the IRPA (due to the combined effect of paragraphs 95(1)(c) and 112(3)(c)) and cannot obtain permanent resident status on an application for protection under section 112 of the IRPA (due to paragraph 114(1)(b)). 3) Did the Board err by applying the criteria set forth <REFERENCE> to find that Mr. Nava Flores was excluded from refugee protection despite the fact that he had completed his sentence for the crime in question?

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [29] The extent of disclosure necessary to uphold principles of procedural fairness is unsettled in the jurisprudence. <TARGETCASE> Justice Sean Harrington held that procedural fairness demanded that an anonymous letter be shown to the individual concerned. The decision involved judicial review of an immigration officer's refusal of an application to sponsor an individual based on humanitarian and compassionate considerations. However, it is important to note that Justice Harrington qualified his findings stating at paragraph 14 that ""[i]t is not absolutely mandatory that extrinsic evidence in this form be given to the applicant.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [21] The failure to give an explanation in support of her reasoning is risky for the adviser as, even if her decision may not appear reasonable a priori, there is a guideline which the Court can follow to determine how she reached her decision ... In the case at bar, there is no guideline to follow. To determine whether the decision was reasonable, therefore, the Court must rely on the evidence presented by the parties. If the evidence points to a result different from that arrived at by the adviser, it will then be difficult for the Court to support the latter's reasoning."" (See <TARGETCASE> .)

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [4] The RCMP LTD policy arguably has a stronger benefit offset clause than the CF LTD policy. In the case of the CF LTD policy the Pension Act offset was held not to be deductible, because the operative contractual clause only permitted the deduction of income benefits and not amounts payable as disability benefits. The RCMP LTD policy does not limit the offset of Pension Act benefits to income replacements but, instead, refers to ""payments [received] under the Pension Act for an occupational disability ""...

question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [36] Section 25 of the IRPA allows for exceptional relief from the requirements of the IRPA based on individual H&C circumstances ( <REFERENCE> Imm LR (3d) 173). There is a high threshold to obtain such relief when applying for permanent residence from outside Canada ( <REFERENCE> Imm LR (3d) 66).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [13] It is clearly within the IRB's jurisdiction to make credibility findings. In fact, it is trite to state the IRB's privileged role to do so. However, these findings must be justified and explained in the reasons. This is required not only by procedural fairness, but also by the reasonableness standard of review, whereby reasons are to be scrutinized just the same as outcomes ( <TARGETCASE> ). ","Credibility findings by the IRB must be justified and explained in the reasons, and these reasons are to be scrutinized just the same as outcomes under the reasonableness standard of review."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [30] Furthermore, it has been held that the Act grants the Commission considerable latitude when performing its screening function. Parliament did not intend courts to intervene in the Commission’s decisions except in the most serious of circumstances. Absent a breach of procedural fairness or an error of law, this Court should intervene only where it is shown that the Commission’s decision is unreasonable. As Justice Robert Décary wrote in <TARGETCASE> is performing its screening function on receipt of an investigation report. Subsections 40(2) and 40(4) and sections 41 and 44 are replete with expressions such as 'is satisfied', 'ought to', 'reasonably available', 'could more appropriately be dealt with', 'all the circumstances', 'considers appropriate in the circumstances' which leave no doubt as to the intent of Parliament. The grounds set out for referral to another authority (subsection 44(2)), for referral to the President of the Human Rights Tribunal Panel (paragraph 44(3)(a)) or for an outright dismissal (paragraph 44(3)(b)) involve in varying degrees questions of fact, law and opinion (see <REFERENCE> (F.C.A.), Le Dain, J.A.), but it may safely be said as a general rule that Parliament did not want the courts at this stage to intervene lightly in the decisions of the Commission."" ","Absent a breach of procedural fairness or an error of law, courts should only intervene in the Commission’s decisions when it is shown that the decision is unreasonable."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [21] Here, the officer's reasons indicate why he does not believe that the applicant is very likely to become economically established in Canada: see <TARGETCASE> , above, at para 45. The Court's task is not to reweigh the evidence and substitute its own analysis for that of the officer. Absent a reviewable error, the Court's intervention is not warranted. The assertion that the evidence was insufficient to rebut the presumption does not constitute a reviewable error as it would require that this Court reweigh the evidence.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [17] The Court has also had a number of other occasions to look at s. 8 without reaching a determination of its meaning. In total, on no less than 11 occasions, this Court and the Federal Court of Appeal have concluded that issues of interpretation of s. 8 should proceed to trial.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [236] In <TARGETCASE> , Justice Evans pointed out in somewhat similar circumstances that the individual's removal does not necessarily abrogate the person's right under section 18.1 of the <REFERENCE> to make an application for judicial review of an unsuccessful PRRA decision. The Court suggested that the respondent could permit the applicant, if successful, to return to Canada pending the redetermination of the PRRA.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [37] I take from the above decisions that a finding of membership is one element that may or may not lead to a finding of personal and knowing participation in international crimes. The underlying first test remains that evidence must establish personal and knowing participation in the proscribed crimes on the standard of ""serious reasons for considering""; a standard lower than the balance of probabilities. <TARGETCASE> ","Evidence must establish personal and knowing participation in the proscribed crimes on the standard of 'serious reasons for considering', a standard lower than the balance of probabilities."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [12] The Minister also relies on cases where there was a question whether the reference to a sentence of imprisonment meant the full term of the sentence imposed by the Court or just the amount of time the offender actually spent in prison before being paroled. For example, where a person was sentenced to 4 years' imprisonment, but only spent 10 months in prison before being paroled, was the person sentenced to a term of imprisonment greater than 2 years (for purposes of s 64(2) of IRPA)? The answer is yes - it is the sentence actually imposed that matters, not the amount of time actually spent in custody. <REFERENCE> aff'd 2005 FCA 347; <REFERENCE> . <TARGETCASE> ","The sentence actually imposed matters, not the amount of time actually spent in custody, for purposes of determining if a person was sentenced to a term of imprisonment greater than 2 years."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [44] Justice Manson decided <TARGETCASE> [ <REFERENCE> ], one month before he decided Abdou. The facts of Donohue are similar to the instant cases, because differing versions of residency all fell short of the statutory requirement. In Donohue , the applicant also challenged the selection of the citizenship test, as well as procedural fairness in the face of credibility concerns and physical residence discrepancies.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [6] In the course of its assessment, the Board found credibility issues associated with the Applicant's claim that he was being targeted because of his bisexual/homosexual relationships. There were inconsistencies and omissions related to central aspects of his claim. He also failed to produce some documentary corroboration that might reasonably be available to him. Some of the specific issues identified by the Board included that: <REFERENCE> Details regarding an attack after his graduation ceremony in June 2004 were not in his Personal Information Form (PIF) and there were no documents, such as a doctor's exam or police report, provided in support of this claim <REFERENCE> Due to inconsistent information, it was unable to conclude the Applicant was forced to leave his job on account of his sexuality in 2006 and 2007 <REFERENCE> A medical certificate indicating the Applicant was treated for a dislocated shoulder did not state that it was the result of an attack in March 2007 as he claimed <REFERENCE> He could not satisfactorily explain why he returned to Chisinau after he and his friend Sergey were alleged to have been beaten outside a café in October 2007 <TARGETCASE> Information showing he was a currently a member of a Toronto church with a support group for bisexual and homosexual individuals was not sufficient <REFERENCE> III.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [16] This is not a case in which the Court must determine whether the Officer erred in assessing the applicant's complicity in any terrorist acts committed by the organization. The test for complicity was modified by the Supreme Court in <REFERENCE> . <TARGETCASE> involved the application of section 98 of the IRPA , which incorporates the international crimes listed under article 1F(a) of the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees .

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [7] After that decision, it came to the attention of counsel for the applicants that in another case, <REFERENCE> ], my colleague Mr. Justice Dubé had agreed, in reasons, to certify a question in the following terms: <TARGETCASE> ""... the question of change of conditions in the country of origin is a question of general importance, and more precisely the criteria for determining when a change is sufficiently significant. <REFERENCE> ","The question of change of conditions in the country of origin is a question of general importance, and more precisely the criteria for determining when a change is sufficiently significant."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [36] For the reasons discussed at paras 29-31 above, the Visa Officer's findings establish that Mr. Kathiripillai shared a common purpose with the Sri Lankan police force. The Visa Officer's findings also provide a reasonable and sufficient basis for concluding that Mr. Kathiripillai was not an innocent bystander in respect of the routine use of torture by the Sri Lankan police at the places where he worked, but rather knowingly contributed in at least some way to its illegal activities ( <REFERENCE> , above, at para 11; <REFERENCE> , above, at 438). This is sufficient to meet the test of ""personal and knowing participation"" in the widespread use of torture by the Sri Lankan police ( <REFERENCE> , above, at 438-439; <TARGETCASE> , above, at para 53; <REFERENCE> , above, at 323; <REFERENCE> , above, at para 6; <REFERENCE> , above, at para 11).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [30] A change in attitude is necessary for the authorities to truly protect victims, as stated in the document UN Government efforts to include women's issues in law stressed by rep of Saint Vincent & Grenadines , dated January 23, 1997 (Tribunal Record, at page 74): <REFERENCE> ""In the presentation of the report on 16 January, the representative of the island nation stated that, despite the passage of a domestic violence act, an attitudinal change on the part of law enforcement officials was still necessary to stop the battering of women in her country. The prevailing attitude was that what went on in the home was 'the business of the family involved'. In the minds of many, the belief still lingered that it was the right of the man to beat his spouse. Reflecting the conflicting cultural norms of the region, women in Saint Vincent were expected to achieve their full potential and yet remain subordinate to men.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [11] Accordingly, section 25 of the Act requires that a person claiming access to this exemption scheme must provide proof that the application of the system that would otherwise apply, which requires a person to submit a visa application prior to entering Canada, would cause the applicant to personally suffer unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship associated with leaving Canada, with arriving and staying in the foreign country or both ( REFERENCE and 41). The factors must be exceptional because the purpose of the section 25 scheme is not to exempt foreign nationals from the inherent consequences of leaving Canada and applying for permanent residence through normal channels ( TARGETCASE; REFERENCE).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [20] However, as noted above, prior to the decision in <REFERENCE> , the Court of Appeal itself had taken the view that the proper forum for review was this Court. See, for example, <REFERENCE> . The decision in <TARGETCASE> was not released until after Mr. Decker had commenced this application so he cannot be expected to have known that his recourse lay with the Pension Appeals Board and not the Court. This is particularly so where the Attorney General did not raise the decision in <REFERENCE> in this proceeding, notwithstanding that the decision was rendered before the Attorney General filed its responding memorandum of fact and law.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [4] Because the grounds for Mr. Gan’s application concern alleged errors in the Board’s fact and credibility findings, the standard of review is, of course, patent unreasonableness. It is well-established that considerable deference is owed to the evidence-based conclusions reached by the Board and, in particular, to those involving credibility. A useful statement in this regard can be found in <TARGETCASE> 2002 FCT 1194 at para. 5: Credibility findings of the Board are entitled to the highest degree of curial deference, and the Court will only set aside credibility decisions, or grant leave for applications for judicial review of credibility findings, in accordance with the criteria outlined above. The Court should not substitute its opinion for that of the Board with respect to credibility or plausibility except in the clearest of cases. For this reason, applicants seeking to set aside credibility findings have a very heavy onus to discharge both at the stage of seeking leave, and at the hearing if leave is granted. Similarly, deference is owed to the Board’s plausibility inferences: see <REFERENCE> (C.A.) at para. 4.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [10] On the other hand, if we consider the ""pull of bail"", to use a criminal analogy, ""the real effective force that it exerts, is that it may cause the offender to attend his trial rather than subject his nearest and dearest who has gone surety for him to undue pain and discomfort"" ( <TARGETCASE> citing with approval this statement made by Lord Widgery CJ in R v Southampton Justices , ex parte Corker (1976), 120 SJ 214). In the present instance, the Board was simply not persuaded that ""the trust that [the proposed bondsmen] put in [the applicant] is well founded"" since ""history has demonstrated that [the applicant] can't be trusted."" Thus, the Board could reasonably conclude that the proposed bonds are a factor that does not sufficiently outweigh the other considerations: ""[B]ecause you are someone who essentially believes that your life is on the line, I have great difficulty seeing what amount of money you would consider to be worth your life.""

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [90] The respondent submitted that the residency requirement in s. 75(1) of the Indian Act served an ameliorative purpose in that it ensured that band councillors were located on-reserve, and were directly familiar with the issues relevant to decision-making. As noted above in <TARGETCASE> , in addition to addressing local issues, band councils represent individuals who live off-reserve in many important capacities. In any event, I am not persuaded that the preservation of band council positions for on-reserve members to the exclusion of off-reserve members helps a more disadvantaged group. In fact, under cross-examination, Lynn Ashkewe admitted that having a band council formed solely of on-reserve members would not make them more accessible to the majority of members, who live off-reserve.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [15] Subsequent to the hearing of this application for judicial review, two decisions were issued addressing the Board's jurisdiction relative to H&C considerations, that is the decisions in <TARGETCASE> and <REFERENCE> . In those decisions, Justice Harrington and Justice Phelan, respectively, found that the Immigration Appeal Division does not have jurisdiction to adjudicate upon H&C factors in an appeal from a decision of a visa officer where an applicant is not a member of the family class.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [10] In cases in which an existing security clearance was either being revoked or not renewed, the standard has been found to be slightly higher, but still on the lower end of the spectrum. <TARGETCASE> the Court held: With these factors in mind, I agree with the respondent that the duty of procedural fairness in this case is more than minimal but does not require a high level of procedural safeguards (see, for example, <REFERENCE> ",The duty of procedural fairness in cases of revoking or not renewing an existing security clearance is more than minimal but does not require a high level of procedural safeguards.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: His entire analysis of the ability of Mr. Williams to place this restaurant in the hands of some third party for the financial support of his family is extremely questionable and, in my mind, unlikely to meet the reasonableness standard set out by the Supreme Court in Dunsmuir , even given the deference the officer's decision is due. <REFERENCE> 6. This is one of those rare instances where the harm occasioned by the removal of one parent is irreparable harm within the Toth test. The harm is the probable dissolution of the business, and the impact on the children and spouse at a time when many are in need of the applicant's emotional and physical support, in addition to his financial support. Additionally, while his criminal record is of his own making, it will probably result in him not being readmitted to Canada and reunited with his family should the application for judicial review of the refusal to defer be successful. <TARGETCASE> 7.","The harm occasioned by the removal of one parent is considered irreparable harm within the Toth test if it results in probable dissolution of the business and impacts the children and spouse who are in need of the applicant's emotional, physical, and financial support."

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [55] As has been mentioned, the Respondent submits that the Applicant is not a ""child"" partially because Article 1 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child defines children as persons who are under the age of 18 (Respondent's Memorandum of Argument at para. 8). The court in <REFERENCE> , above, implicitly dismissed this argument by preferring to focus on the dependency of the applicants ( <TARGETCASE> at paras. 25, 32).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [100] As Bodum <TARGETCASE> , teaches, knowledge under s. 17(2) of the Act may be imputed (at para 153): Bodum contends that by reason of s 17(2) of the Act, its registration cannot be expunged or amended or held invalid on the ground of the previous use by a person other than Bodum, unless it's established that Bodum adopted the trade-mark in Canada with knowledge of that previous use. Bodum thus argues that the use, for example, of ""French press"" by Hario in 1985 and the use of the term by BonJour in the early 1990s, cannot go to invalidating the registration. I infer from the evidence that Bodum corporate management, specifically Jørgen Bodum and Carsten Jorgensen, knew of the previous use of the term when they adopted it as a trade-mark because of their knowledge of the marketplace and concerns expressed to Koen de Winter about the BonJour competition. For that reason, I impute the necessary knowledge to Bodum and will order that the trade-mark be expunged.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [51] Even if the plaintiffs were able to meet this threshold test, it has been held that the Charter is not ""existing and applicable Federal law"", as it is not an enactment of the federal government ( <TARGETCASE> ). Therefore, a bare declaration of invalidity of a federal statute, when not allied to another cause of action cannot be issued by the Federal Court. After the comments made by counsel for the plaintiffs during argument with respect to the application of the Charter, I feel that it is necessary to add, if any doubt exists, that the Federal Court will not hesitate to give full force and effect to the Charter rights of litigants when it has the jurisdiction to do so.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [6] On June 14, 2010, Prothonotary Morneau issued an order whereby the Court declined jurisdiction ratione materiae over the dispute. The Prothonotary decided that the matter was, in pith and substance, a disagreement as to the interpretation or implementation of an agreement concerning a share transfer and its consequences. He referred to the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in <TARGETCASE> ( ITO ) and found that the subject matter in dispute was not so integrally connected to maritime matters as to be considered a maritime law matter.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [39] The Board was therefore entitled to consider that the crime for which the Applicant was convicted was, prima facie , a serious crime for the purpose of Article 1F(b), and did not err even with hindsight of the <REFERENCE> decision in the Supreme Court. There is no basis for the proposition put forward by counsel for the Applicant, either in the wording of Article 1F(b) or in the Travaux préparatoires of the Refugee Convention , that the true test of seriousness is whether the crime is such as to make the Applicant undeserving of protection, and that the crimes encompassed in Article 1F(b) are meant to be as serious as the crimes in Articles 1F(a) (crime against peace, war crime, or crime against humanity). As Justice Décary wrote in <TARGETCASE> Article 1F(b) was the result of a delicate compromise between state sovereignty and human rights: ...[It] indicates that while the signatories were prepared to sacrifice their sovereignty, even their security, in the case of the perpetrators of political crimes, they wished on the contrary to preserve them for reasons of security and social peace in the case of the perpetrators of serious ordinary crimes.

Whether the decision-maker has erred in law or in appreciation of the facts in determining whether an arguable case is raised.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [14] <REFERENCE> pp. 326 and 327 <REFERENCE> : <TARGETCASE> ""On a standard of ""serious reasons for considering that ... he has committed a crime against peace, a war crime or a crime against humanity,"" I cannot see the appellant's case as even a borderline one. He was aware of a very large number of interrogations carried out by the military, on what may have been as much as a twice-weekly basis (following some 130-160 military engagements) during his 20 months of active service. He could never be classed as a simple on-looker, but was on all occasions a participating and knowing member of a military force, one of whose common objectives was the torture of prisoners to extract information. This was one of the things his army did, regularly and repeatedly, as he admitted. He was a part of the operation, even if he personally was in no sense a ""cheering section"". In other words, his presence at this number of incidents of persecution, coupled with his sharing in the common purpose of the military forces, clearly constitutes complicity. We need not define for purposes of this case, the moment at which complicity may be said to have been established, because this case is not to my mind near the borderline. The appellant was no innocent by-stander: he was an integral, albeit reluctant, part of the military enterprise that produced those terrible moments of collectively deliberate inhumanity. <REFERENCE> ","Presence at incidents of persecution, coupled with sharing in the common purpose of the military forces, constitutes complicity in crimes such as war crimes or crimes against humanity."

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [77] In REFERENCE, Justice Pinard noted, with respect to a claim that the applicant was persecuted due to her religion, at para 20: ...Since the applicant was not considered to be a genuine practicing Christian, the Board need not consider whether the applicant would be at risk of religious persecution in China. Thereby, this is not a case where the applicant's religious activities in Canada might give rise to negative reaction on the part of Chinese authorities if forced to return to China (see TARGETCASE).

Although it is true that domestic law, especially the words of legislation such as the IRPR , can trump international law when directly relevant to the domestic law term in question, the Court stresses that the definitions in section 2 of the IRPR are not applicable to the IRPA .

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [11] This issue has been raised before in numerous judicial review applications before this <REFERENCE> (T.D.), the Court stated that the Board must explain why it rejected the psychological report. This is not the case here, as the Board does not reject the psychological report, it acknowledges it; but then states that it does not in itself support the underlying story. A similar reasoning is found in <REFERENCE> (T.D.), where Justice Noël states at paragraph 10: The Board having considered the psychological report, concluded while taking into account the Applicant's psychological profile, that his testimony was inconsistent as well as incoherent and all of which impacted on the assessment of his credibility. Such an approach shows, as was the case in <TARGETCASE> that the Board read and considered the psychological report, but concluded that the diagnosis did not alter its findings of fact: Here the Board did consider the psychological report and decided that it did not influence its analysis of the facts.","The Board must read and consider the psychological report, but may conclude that the diagnosis does not alter its findings of fact."

This is not a case where the documentary evidence was preferred to the applicant's evidence without providing any reasons. It is well established that when a tribunal prefers the documentary evidence over an applicant's testimony, it must clearly explain why: ""In this case, the Board never explicitly states that it found the Applicant's testimony not credible, but it does reject his account of the raid on the house church, the existence of a warrant for his arrest, and his testimony that three other members have been sentenced to imprisonment for their membership in the house church and/or participation in its activities. Its stated reasons for rejecting the Applicant's evidence is that it prefers the documentary evidence as not having 'a personal interest in the outcome of the hearing' (Board decision, p. 5).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [49] Mr. Orr submits that the Election Regulations must comply with the constitutional right to democracy, which includes, but is broader than the rights specifically stated in s 3 of the Charter (REFERENCE). Drawing parallels to REFERENCE , Mr. Orr submits that the rule of law shields all Canadians from arbitrary state action and permits a citizen to sue the government. Mr. Orr submits that s 9.3(c) is contrary to democracy and the rule of law, and is an abuse of power as it is plainly an attempt by the PTFN to prevent its members from bringing actions against the PTFN government. In order for s 9.3(c) to be justified by s 1 of the Charter , it must be established that there is a constitutionally valid purpose or objective achieved by the limit, and no such proof was provided by the PTFN in the appeal arbitration. Prior to the passage of the Charter , it was held that governments could not prevent citizens from bringing actions against them because such legislation was ultra vires ( REFERENCE , REFERENCE , TARGETCASE ).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [23] As stated by Justice Martineau at para 7 of <TARGETCASE> FTR 43: 7 The determination of an applicant's credibility is the heartland of the Board's jurisdiction. This Court has found that the Board has well-established expertise in the determination of questions of fact, particularly in the evaluation of the credibility and the subjective fear of persecution of an applicant: see <REFERENCE> at para. 38 (QL) (T.D.); and <REFERENCE> at para. 14.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [40] <REFERENCE> (T.D.) Justice Pinard reviewed the applicable standard of review to be applied to decisions of the nature challenged in this proceeding. He wrote as follows, at paragraph 4: ""The decision to transfer an inmate to one institution rather than another is a discretionary decision ( <TARGETCASE> ). The general rule on the standard of control applicable to such a discretionary decision was succinctly stated by McIntyre, J., in Maple Lodge <REFERENCE> , at 7 and 8: 'It is, as well, a clearly-established rule that the courts should not interfere with the exercise of a discretion by a statutory authority merely because the court might have exercised the discretion in a different manner had it been charged with that responsibility. Where the statutory discretion has been exercised in good faith and, where required, in accordance with the principles of natural justice, and where reliance has not been placed upon considerations irrelevant or extraneous to the statutory purpose, the courts should not interfere.'"" ",The decision to transfer an inmate to one institution rather than another is a discretionary decision.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [26] There is no doubt that international treaties and conventions are not part of Canadian law unless they have been implemented by statute (see, inter alia, <REFERENCE> ). Nevertheless, it is now recognized that international human rights law may be used as an aid in interpreting domestic law, even if not formally implemented by statutes. This was clearly enunciated by Madam Justice L'Heureux-Dubé in <REFERENCE> ; 257 F.T.R. 290 (F.C.A.): <REFERENCE> ""I have concluded that s. 3(3)(f) of IRPA codifies the common law canon of statutory construction that domestic law should be interpreted to reflect the values contained in international human rights conventions to which Canada has ascribed. In Baker , supra, the Supreme court held tat paragraph 70 that the human rights values in these international conventions 'help inform the contextual approach' which the Court should incorporate when interpreting statutes. However, s. 3(3)(f) of IRPA does not incorporate international human rights conventions as part of Canadian law, or state that they override plain words in a statute. Section 3(3)(f) of IRPA means that the conventions be considered by the Court as 'context' when interpreting ambiguous provisions of the immigration law (at para. 53). <TARGETCASE> ","Domestic law should be interpreted to reflect the values contained in international human rights conventions to which Canada has ascribed, and these conventions should be considered as 'context' when interpreting ambiguous provisions of the immigration law, but they do not override plain words in a statute."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [26] Because the Citizenship Act does not define ""residence"" or ""resident"" and precludes appeals to the Federal Court of Appeal, the jurisprudence of this Court is divided as to the legal test an applicant must meet in order to satisfy the residency requirement of paragraph 5(1)(c). As a result, three different tests for residency have emerged, to which I have already referred in paragraph 16 of these reasons. So long as the Citizenship Judge adopts one of these three tests, clearly identifies the test adopted and properly applies the facts of the case to the chosen approach, this Court will not intervene: see, for example, <TARGETCASE> at paras. 11-14; <REFERENCE> ","So long as the Citizenship Judge adopts one of the three tests for residency, clearly identifies the test adopted and properly applies the facts of the case to the chosen approach, this Court will not intervene."

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [109] Although the applicant relies on TARGETCASE for the argument that credibility findings should not be made without an oral hearing, the jurisprudence regarding the standard of review the RAD applies to RPD decisions and the prevailing view that the RAD should defer to the RPD on its credibility findings given that the RPD has had the benefit of hearing an applicant first hand should also be considered.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [37] After the hearing but before the Board issued its decision, Ms. Myle's counsel submitted to the Board a most recent decision on a similar case from St. Vincent which appears to direct the Board's attention to this issue of state protection and that of IFA. In <REFERENCE> , above, Justice Yves de Montigny states the following, at paragraphs 25-27: ""In the circumstances of this case, I do not think that it was objectively reasonable to expect the applicant to have further sought the protection from the police after having been rebuffed or ignored previously. Considering the poor record of St-Vincent and the Grenadines with respect to the protection of assaulted women, it is not difficult to conceive of the enormous difficulties a woman with unorthodox sexual practices is likely to encounter in complaining about the physical abuses she has been subjected to. For these reasons, and applying the reasonableness simpliciter standard of review, I believe the Board was not sensitive enough to her predicaments and asked for too much in terms of a proof that the state was incapable to protect her: see, by analogy, <TARGETCASE> (QL).","It was not objectively reasonable to expect the applicant to have further sought the protection from the police after having been rebuffed or ignored previously, and the Board asked for too much in terms of a proof that the state was incapable to protect her."

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [46] That opinion, which I share, is supported by the undisputed empirical evidence that in Canada between 74% and 81% of all positions are for a duration of less than five years. There may not be any case law that corresponds exactly to the factual situation of the case at bar, but the precedents interpreting the former Public Service Employment Act (while not necessarily conclusive here) may be useful. <TARGETCASE> ; 93 F.T.R. 312 (T.D.), my colleague Tremblay-Lamer, J., considered that a position which was the subject of acting appointments over a period of two years ceased to be acting and that a new position had de facto been created.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: I find it useful to reproduce the following passage from L. Waldman, Immigration Law and Practice (Markham: Butterworths Canada Ltd. 1992) at page 8.10, paragraph § 8.22 which deals with plausibility findings and the impact of documentary evidence that may be before the tribunal: § 8.22 Plausibility findings should only be made in the clearest of cases - where the facts as presented are either so far outside the realm of what could reasonably be expected that the trier of fact can reasonably find that it could not possibly have happened, or where the documentary evidence before the tribunal demonstrates that the events could not have happened in the manner asserted by the claimant. Plausibility findings should therefore be ""nourished"" by reference to the documentary evidence. Moreover, a tribunal rendering a decision based on lack of plausibility must proceed cautiously, especially when one considers that refugee claimants come from diverse cultures, so that actions which might appear implausible if judged by Canadian standards might be plausible when considered within the context of the claimant's background . [Emphasis added.] ( TARGETCASE).","Plausibility findings should only be made in the clearest of cases and must be nourished by reference to the documentary evidence, with caution exercised when considering the diverse cultural backgrounds of refugee claimants."

In the case at bar, to the degree that the president and sole shareholder of the defendant company did not acquire knowledge of the certificate within the meaning of art. 484 C.C.P. until April 28, 1995, I think that for the purposes of the motion in revocation of judgment filed with the Federal Court Registry on May 12, 1995, service was not made out of time.

The Applicant relies on the rebuttable presumption of the truth of the contents of documents purported to be issued by a foreign jurisdiction, absent valid reasons to reject them ( TARGETCASE). The Respondent argues that the Board's other adverse credibility findings represent a valid basis for it to have rejected the authenticity of the summons.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: The requirement that an individual ""Keep the peace and be of good behaviour"" is one commonly seen in orders staying deportations under the former Immigration Act , and is, as well, a statutory condition in all probation orders in the criminal context: Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [92] In REFERENCE, the Federal Court of Appeal noted the parameters applicable to the right to gain access to documents that were not before the decision-maker when it made the decision: To obtain the disclosure of material that was not before the Commissioner when he made his decision, the applicant had to prove that the material sought is relevant within the meaning of Rule 317. First, since as a general rule a judicial review case must be decided on the basis of the information in the decision-maker's possession at the time the decision is made, the applicant had to raise in his request a ground of review that would allow the Court to consider evidence that was not before the Commissioner. These exceptions to the general rule are well settled by the case law. In the present case, the only relevant exception was a breach of procedural fairness, namely, the investigator's purported bias, which had allegedly tainted the entire investigation process. Second, the ground of review had to have a factual basis supported by appropriate evidence, as required ( TARGETCASE). The second criterion is particularly important because it prevents an applicant raising a breach of procedural fairness simply to gain access to material that the applicant could not otherwise access. ","The applicant must prove the material sought is relevant and raise a ground of review that allows the Court to consider evidence not before the decision-maker at the time of the decision, with a factual basis supported by appropriate evidence, to gain access to documents not before the decision-maker."

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [47] The Federal Court of Appeal in REFERENCE, had another opportunity to consider when deferral of removal may be appropriate. Mr. TARGETCASE asked the enforcement officer to defer his removal pending his application for judicial review of a negative PRRA decision.

The content of the duty of procedural fairness depends on a number of factors, including: the ""nature of the decision being made and the process followed in making it""; the ""nature of the statutory scheme and the 'terms of the statute pursuant to which the body operates'""; the ""importance of the decision to the individual or individuals affected""; the ""legitimate expectations of the person challenging the decision""; and the requirement to ""respect the choices of procedure made by the agency itself, particularly when the statute leaves to the decision-maker the ability to choose its own procedures, or when the agency has an expertise in determining what procedures are appropriate in the circumstances"" ( Baker , above, at paras. 22-27). <TARGETCASE> ","The content of the duty of procedural fairness depends on factors such as the nature of the decision and the process followed, the statutory scheme, the importance of the decision to the affected individual(s), the legitimate expectations of the person challenging the decision, and the requirement to respect the choices of procedure made by the agency itself."

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [33] Counsel for the Minister accepts the principle based on Atchison above, that persons applying ex parte to the Court must ""use the utmost amount of good faith and, if they do not, they cannot keep the results."" In that case, Justice Sheppard set aside the ex parte Jeopardy Order because there was a gap in the Minister's evidence who had not spelled out how a delay in collection from either taxpayer would jeopardize the Minister's debt. He was of the view delay in collection was attributable to the Minister who also had failed to disclose negotiations on collection with the taxpayer concerned. I note that in <TARGETCASE> above a case decided before Atchison , Justice Joyal accepted the principle that serious defects in the Minister's affidavit evidence could impugn the jeopardy order cautioning, however, that the standard of disclosure was not that established for Mareva injunctions and in order to assess the appropriate level of disclosure, he was entitled to examine all of the affidavit evidence before the issuing judge in order to determine whether those affidavits disclosed ""essential elements"" without reading those affidavits to ""theological dissection.""

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [24] Rationale for the broad interpretation of these inadmissibility provisions of IRPA can be found in the words of Justice Rothstein in Canada (Minister of Citizenship and <TARGETCASE> Imm. L.R.(2d) 309 (T.D.), at paragraph 52. In speaking of the almost identical provisions in the previous act, he stated: <REFERENCE> ""The provisions deal with subversion and terrorism.

There is no formal test for membership and members are not therefore easily identifiable. The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration may, if not detrimental to the national interest, exclude an individual from the operation of subparagraph 19(1)(f)(iii)(B). I think it is obvious that Parliament intended the term 'member' to be given an unrestricted and broad interpretation. I find no support for the view that a person is not a member as contemplated by the provision if he or she became a member after the organization stopped engaging in terrorism. If such membership is benign, the Minister has discretion to exclude the individual from the operation of the provision.""

The Court rejected this argument, and said at paragraphs 26-27: At first blush, it appears that the Prime Minister's decision to advise the Governor General is not reviewable because the power to dissolve Parliament is the Governor General's prerogative, not the Prime Minister's; however, the Prime Minister's power can be seen as a prerogative because, it is discretionary, it is not based on a statutory grant of power and has its roots in the historical power of the Monarch.

The Court rejected this argument and held ""whether one characterizes the Prime Minister's actions as communicating Canada's policy on honours to the Queen, giving her advice on Mr. Black's peerage, or opposing Mr. Black's appointment, he was exercising the prerogative power of the Crown relating to honours"" ( <TARGETCASE> prerogative.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [39] Likewise, the words of Justice Russel Zinn in <REFERENCE> re equally applicable to the case before me: <REFERENCE> I find that there is no merit to the submission that the officer ought to have provided the applicant with an opportunity to address his concerns. Justice Russell in <REFERENCE> reviewed the law as to when a visa officer ought to provide such an opportunity. Relying on <TARGETCASE> he noted firstly that there was no statutory right to an interview, or any dialogue of the sort suggested here. Secondly, it was noted that generally an opportunity to respond is available only when the officer has information of which the applicant is not aware. As in Ling, that is not the situation here and thus no opportunity was required to be given to Mr. Singh to address the officer's concerns. Further, when as here the officer is relying only on materials submitted by or known to the applicant, there is no need for an interview. <REFERENCE> ","There is no statutory right to an interview or any dialogue, and an opportunity to respond is generally only available when the officer has information of which the applicant is not aware."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [30] In <REFERENCE> , above, the Supreme Court of Canada had the following to say on point: ""23. While discoverability has been qualified in the past as a 'general rule' ( Central Trust , at p. 224; <REFERENCE> , at [page 68] para. 36), it must not be applied systematically without a thorough balancing of competing interests ( <TARGETCASE> , at para. 34). The rule is an interpretative tool for construing limitation statutes. I agree with the Manitoba Court of Appeal when it writes: 'In my opinion, the judge-made discoverability rule is nothing more than a rule of construction. Whenever a statute requires an action to be commenced within a specified time from the happening of a specific event, the statutory language must be construed. When time runs from ""the accrual of the cause of action"" or from some other event which can be construed as occurring only when the injured party has knowledge of the injury sustained, the judge-made discoverability rule applies.",The discoverability rule is an interpretative tool for construing limitation statutes and must not be applied systematically without a thorough balancing of competing interests.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [63] By its very nature, the doctrine of sound prediction presupposes that the patentee's work is not complete. Logically, therefore, the promise need not have been met at the date of filing, although it must ultimately be fulfilled ( <TARGETCASE> date or there was a sound prediction, a patent claim may still be held invalid if it is established at trial that the claim includes embodiments that do not meet the promised utility ( <REFERENCE> FTR 88, 167 ACWS (3d) 984, who relied on an excerpt of Professor Blanco White, the concept of utility may overlap with those of insufficiency and misleading representations under subsection 53(1) of the Act (also cited by my colleague Justice Gauthier in <REFERENCE> FC 361; aff'd 2011 FCA 83 ( <REFERENCE> )).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [12] The Commission's role is well known. Essentially, it is to assess the sufficiency of the evidence prior to referring a complaint to the Tribunal. The Commission's role is very modest: it is not to determine whether the complaint has merit, but, rather, whether an inquiry is warranted having regard to all the facts. Thus, the threshold is rather low, and questions related to the credibility of witnesses are normally left to the Tribunal to assess. <REFERENCE> (F.C.A.) at paragraph 35 (C.A.) ( Bell Canada ); <REFERENCE> at paragraphs 52 and 53; and Syndicat des employés de production du Québec et de l' <TARGETCASE> at 898 and 899 ( SEPQA ). <REFERENCE> ","The Commission's role is to assess the sufficiency of the evidence prior to referring a complaint to the Tribunal, not to determine whether the complaint has merit, but whether an inquiry is warranted having regard to all the facts."

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: The certified question posed and the answer given in <REFERENCE> is as follows: ""Q.: Is the requirement that the best interests of children be considered when disposing of an application for an exemption pursuant to subsection 114(2), as set out in <REFERENCE> , satisfied by considering whether the removal of the parent will subject the child to unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship? A.: The requirement that the best interests of the child be considered may be satisfied, depending on the circumstances of each case , by considering the degree of hardship to which the removal of a parent exposes the child."" (Emphasis added) ( Hawthorne, at para. 11) Thus, <REFERENCE> stands for the proposition that the best interests of a child must always be determined in H&C applications, but, specifically for inland applications, the reality of the situation might focus the analysis on the suffering that a child will experience as a result of the removal of a person from Canada ( <TARGETCASE> ).","The best interests of a child must always be determined in H&C applications, and for inland applications, the focus might be on the suffering that a child will experience as a result of the removal of a person from Canada."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [26] Third, it is submitted that the applicants' conduct is far less serious than those in reported cases concerning fraud under section 69 of the PSEA. For example, in <REFERENCE> aff'd 2012 FCA 314 the applicant provided a falsified reference, claiming an individual to be her supervisor, and writing the false reference on this individual's behalf. <REFERENCE> [ <REFERENCE> ], the applicant somehow obtained access to the correction guide for an exam and copied out the answers word for word. <TARGETCASE> the applicant falsely claimed an educational qualification on his resume. According to the applicant, these cases reflect more serious conduct, all of which evince deliberate intent to deceive in order to gain an advantage in the appointment process.

According to this standard, the Court's analysis of the Board's decision will be concerned with ""the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process [and also with] [...] whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law"" ( <TARGETCASE> , above, at paragraph 47).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [84] Vice-Chairperson Mooney also declined to order production of documentation related to another job posting involving other individuals. Mr. Agnaou alleges this also raises a reasonable apprehension of bias. I disagree, as it was well within Vice-Chairperson Mooney's authority to find such documents to be irrelevant. Labour boards and decision-makers are granted wide freedom with respect to determining the admissibility of evidence; the decision-maker's choice to allow or to reject certain is not, in and of itself, sufficient to infer bias (see e.g. <REFERENCE> at para 18 [ <REFERENCE> ]). As Justice MacKay stated in <TARGETCASE> at para 22 [ <REFERENCE> ]: Parliament has seen fit to give administrative tribunals, such as the adjudicator or the Board in this case considerable latitude to accept and hear evidence without getting tied up in objections and procedural wrangling. Such an arrangement is conducive to informal hearings where all relevant materials can be brought before the tribunal for expedited review.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [34] I share his view that ""espionage"" does not connote the same level of intent, hostile or otherwise, as ""subversion."" This interpretation is reinforced when subsection 34(1) is read in its entirety. The combined use of the words ""espionage"" and ""subversion"" in subsection 34(1)(a) suggests, as Justice Gibson found in <TARGETCASE> (T.D.), that their meanings are disjunctive. This, in turn, suggests that ""espionage"" does not have to have an illicit outcome as its goal. <REFERENCE> ","The meanings of 'espionage' and 'subversion' are disjunctive, suggesting that 'espionage' does not have to have an illicit outcome as its goal."

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [17] At paragraph 8 of his affidavit, the visa officer refers to the study plans as ""less than fully credible."" However, when that sentence is read in the context of the entire paragraph, it is apparent that the visa officer did not have concerns about the Applicant's credibility. Rather, the visa officer's concerns related to the relevance of the Applicant's proposed studies in a law clerk program in Canada to his father's construction business in Iran. <TARGETCASE> ",The visa officer's concerns related to the relevance of the Applicant's proposed studies in a law clerk program in Canada to his father's construction business in Iran.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [27] The Officer's refusal to grant permanent resident visas to the Applicants was based on her finding that the Applicants had not met one of the cumulative requirements set forth in subsection 139(1) of the IRPR .

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [129] Requiring another ""round"" of fairness would have been equivalent to requiring that the officer provide the applicant with an intermediate outcome of her analysis of documents he had submitted. The duty of fairness may require that the applicant have a fair opportunity to respond to concerns raised by documents that he himself has submitted if the officer has concerns about the credibility, accuracy or genuineness of the information submitted ( REFERENCE; TARGETCASE; REFERENCE; REFERENCE). This duty does not stretch to the point of requiring an officer to provide an applicant with a preliminary analysis of the evidence that he has submitted (REFERENCE; REFERENCE; REFERENCE). In this case, the officer did not have doubts regarding the authenticity or credibility of the documents that the applicant provided; rather she drew inferences and conclusions from these documents.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [29] Both parties were in agreement that the proper standard of review to apply when the Commission dismisses a complaint is reasonableness, and rightly so. The Supreme Court of Canada, the Federal Court of Appeal and this Court have all confirmed in the past that the Commission acts as an administrative and screening body when deciding whether a complaint should be referred to the Tribunal for inquiry under sections 44 and 49 of the Act . The Commission does not decide a complaint on its merits at this stage, but determines whether having regard to all the circumstances, it is satisfied that an inquiry into the complaint is warranted. Such a decision is administrative in nature, and therefore discretionary (see Syndicat , above; <TARGETCASE> , at page 891). ","The Commission's decision on whether an inquiry into a complaint is warranted is administrative in nature, and therefore discretionary."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [25] In Chieu [see footnote 11], Justice Iacobucci, for the Court, wrote at paragraph 84: <TARGETCASE> Only the C.R.D.D. [now the R.P.D.] has the jurisdiction to determine that an individual is a Convention refugee. The I.A.D. cannot make such a finding, nor does it do so when it exercises its discretion to allow a permanent resident facing removal to remain in Canada. When exercising its discretionary jurisdiction, the I.A.D. does not directly apply the 1951 Geneva Convention , which protects individuals against persecution based on race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. Instead, the I.A.D. considers a broader range of factors, many of which are closely related to the individual being removed, such as considerations relating to language, family, health, and children. Even when examining country conditions, the I.A.D. can consider factors such as famine, that are not considered by the C.R.D.D. when determining if an individual is a Convention refugee. These foreign concerns are weighed against the relevant domestic considerations in making the final decision as to the proper exercise of the I.A.D.'s discretion. As a result of this broad-based balancing exercise, the protections offered to non-refugee permanent residents are of a different nature than those provided to Convention refugees. In this respect, I reiterate that it is only refugees who are protected from refoulement , as guaranteed by Article 33 of the 1951 Geneva Convention ... . <REFERENCE> ","Only the C.R.D.D. has the jurisdiction to determine that an individual is a Convention refugee, the I.A.D. cannot make such a finding but considers a broader range of factors when exercising its discretionary jurisdiction."

The court is called on to determine, on an objective basis, what a hypothetical skilled person would have understood the claims to mean ( Whirlpool , above at paras 45, 53).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [78] While this is not a criminal case, fundamental justice considerations under section 7 of the Charter do apply. In <TARGETCASE> 2 , at paragraph 53, the Court noted that: ""But whether or not the constitutional guarantees of s. 7 of the Charter apply does not turn on a formal distinction between the different areas of law.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [75] A helpful description of the ""skilled technician"" that this Court and experts giving evidence in this proceeding must contemplate when considering an allegation of obviousness was provided by Justice Hugessen for the Federal Court of Appeal in <TARGETCASE> C.P.R.(3d) 289; 38 A.C.W.S.(2d) 415 (F.C.A.), at 294: ""The test for obviousness is not to ask what competent inventors did or would have done to solve the problem. Inventors are by definition inventive. The classical touchstone for obviousness is the technician skilled in the art but having no scintilla of inventiveness or imagination; a paragon of deduction and dexterity, wholly devoid of intuition; a triumph of the left hemisphere over the right. The question to be asked is whether this mythical creature (the man in the Clapham omnibus of patent law) would, in the light of the state of the art and of common general knowledge as at the claimed date of invention, have come directly and without difficulty to the solution taught by the patent. It is a very difficult test to satisfy."" This test has been widely cited and followed by this Court.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [4], the use of ""serious efforts"" in this sentence is equated to a state's ""due diligence"" efforts to provide practical state protection. However, there is a sharp difference between due diligence in developing policy and giving education on a certain issue, and putting the policy or education into actual operation. This point has particular importance to protection against violence against women if the sentence under consideration is extended to contexts other than terrorism. <TARGETCASE> ","There is a sharp difference between due diligence in developing policy and education on a certain issue, and putting the policy or education into actual operation."

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: The issue is not whether the claim can possibly succeed at trial, but rather whether it is ""clearly without foundation:"" REFERENCE. It must be evident that a trial is unnecessary: REFERENCE. It is not the Court's function on a motion for summary judgment to resolve an issue of fact but rather to determine whether such a genuine issue exists: REFERENCE. 6. Summary judgment cannot be granted if the necessary facts cannot be found or if it would be unjust: REFERENCE. Rather, such a judgment is granted where the evidence is uncontested, or uncontroversial, or where there is no serious issue as to credibility: REFERENCE. 7. Before granting summary judgment, the Court must weigh the various competing interests, namely those of the defendant in avoiding needless litigation, those of the plaintiff having his ""day in court,"" and those of the judicial system in not wasting resources: REFERENCE. In doing this weighing one must exercise caution: TARGETCASE.","In granting summary judgment, the Court must exercise caution when weighing various competing interests."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [58] This argument misunderstands the origins and purpose of judicial independence. Parliament is free to craft legislation and the courts must, assuming it is constitutional, interpret and apply that legislation as written. It is not interference with judicial independence for Parliament to write legislation which leads to a certain outcome when properly applied. This is the proper function of lawmaking, of which there are many examples. <TARGETCASE> , Imperial Tobacco , and Babcock involved legislative change or adaptation to what would otherwise be decided through judicial process. In <REFERENCE> , causes of action to recover interest were barred; in Imperial Tobacco , a duty of care and causation were decreed by legislation and in Babcock , relevant evidence could be rendered inadmissible by a certificate of the Clerk of the Privy Council.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [33] In this regard, doubting the effectiveness of state protection without reasonably testing it, or simply asserting a subjective reluctance to engage the state, does not rebut the presumption of state protection ( <REFERENCE> ; Kim , above). In the absence of a compelling or persuasive explanation, a failure to take reasonable steps to exhaust all courses of action reasonably available in the home state, prior to seeking refugee protection abroad, typically will provide a reasonable basis for a conclusion by the RPD that an applicant for protection did not displace the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence ( <TARGETCASE> ). <REFERENCE> ","A failure to take reasonable steps to exhaust all courses of action reasonably available in the home state, prior to seeking refugee protection abroad, typically will provide a reasonable basis for a conclusion that an applicant for protection did not displace the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [206] Since its implementation in June 2004, this Court has examined Guideline 7 in a number of decisions. The jurisprudence to date has not dealt specifically with the issue of waiver as it relates to an applicant's ability to argue Guideline 7 upon judicial review. Among the cases, there are two common scenarios in which the Court has addressed Guideline 7. The first scenario is one in which the applicant raised an objection to the implementation of Guideline 7 at the hearing before the Board and the issue of waiver was not dealt with on judicial review.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [51] At page five of the decision, the Officer correctly stated that the Applicant bore the onus to show that any adverse country conditions would directly and personally affect her ( REFERENCE). However, the Officer appears to qualify that by saying: ""I find the applicant has failed to establish the facts of her case as it pertains to adverse country conditions in that she would be subjected to conditions not faced by the general populace "" (emphasis added). It goes without saying that someone can be personally affected by a particular problem no matter how many other people in their country of origin are also affected by it. Importing a strict legal rule from paragraph 97(1)(b)(ii) of the IRPA betrays the underlying purpose of H&C discretion and directly violates section 25(1.3) of IRPA ( TARGETCASE). However, I do not think this one misstatement affects the reasonableness of the Officer's decision as a whole or makes the outcome of the decision fall outside the range of acceptable outcomes. In all other respects, the Officer correctly stated the test and the factual findings support the conclusion that the Applicant would not be personally affected. Consequently, the decision is still understandable and reasonable as a whole. VI.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [42] The RPD misapplied the test for state protection which the Supreme Court of Canada set out in Ward , above. The RPD relied on institutional structures in the Slovak Republic for its finding that she had not rebutted the presumption of state protection. The Applicant points to <REFERENCE> where Justice Luc Martineau held as follows at paragraph 56: It is also wrong in law for the Board to adopt a ""systemic""approach which may have the net effect of denying individual refugee claims on the sole ground that the documentary evidence generally shows the Hungarian government is making some efforts to protect Romas from persecution or discrimination by police authorities, housing authorities and other groups that have historically persecuted them. The existence of anti-discrimination provisions in itself is not proof that state protection is available in practice: ""Ability of a state to protect must be seen to comprehend not only the existence of an effective legislative and procedural framework but the capacity and the will to effectively implement that framework"" ( <TARGETCASE> at 121). Hungary is now considered a democratic nation which normally would be considered as being able to provide state protection to all its citizens ( Ward , supra ). Unfortunately, there are still doubts concerning the effectiveness of the means taken by the government to reach this goal. Therefore, a ""reality check"" with the claimants' own experiences appears necessary in all cases.

It is recognized by this Court that, if all the documents had been adequately considered, the reasons would have demonstrated, at the very least, a logical inherence derived from the analysis of significant, pertinent, detailed evidence, thus, within a framework of potential outcomes as set out by the Supreme Court in the <TARGETCASE> and Newfoundland and <REFERENCE> decisions; however, the evidence in respect of the ""forgery"", itself, central to the very core of the Applicant's claim, cannot be said to have been assessed.

The Respondent submits the Panel's reasons adequately describe its decision-making process and provide enough detail for a meaningful review (Respondent's Memorandum of Fact and Law at para. 35).

In that case, the appointment of a competent interpreter had caused problems.

It is clear from the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in <REFERENCE> (F.C.A.) that failure by administrative decision makers to investigate obviously crucial evidence where an omission has been made that cannot be compensated for by making further submissions, there has been a lack of procedural fairness such that the decision must be set aside.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: Indeed, in my opinion, this is the test that should not only be applied to a state's ""serious efforts"" to protect women, but should be accepted as the appropriate test with respect to all protection contexts. <REFERENCE> 18 Justice La Forest stated in <REFERENCE> at 724 that ""it would seem to defeat the purpose of international protection if a claimant would be required to risk his or her life seeking ineffective protection of a state, merely to demonstrate that ineffectiveness. <REFERENCE> 19 Evidence of improvement and progress by the state is not evidence that the current response amounts to adequate, effective protection.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [16] In this case, as <REFERENCE> -Oskoi , the tribunal reached its conclusion about change in circumstances (in this case in Bangladesh where the applicants Bhuiyan were citizens) on the basis of documentary evidence. Unlike the tribunal <REFERENCE> -Oskoi , here the CRDD panel did refer to other documentary evidence that was not supportive of its conclusion and it set out the reasons why in its view the changes, though it admitted these were fragile, were effective to preclude a reasonable fear of persecution, on an objective basis, on the part of the applicants, in light of the evidence they had adduced. I concluded that the tribunal's assessment in this case could not be characterized as perverse or capricious or made without regard to the evidence before it, nor that it so ignored the evidence before it that it could be said to have erred in law. I was not persuaded that the tribunal had erred in a manner described in s. 18.1(4) of the Federal Court Act .

In the case at bar, the RPD's assessment of the Applicant's credibility and her lack of subjective fear are essentially based on her travel history outside of Colombia, specifically in Panama and Venezuela. I find the RPD's negative credibility determination reasonable. Indeed, the Applicant first denied to have travelled to any countries outside Colombia and then admitted to have travelled to Panama in 2009 and to Venezuela in 2012, with a group of teachers for the purpose of ""just visiting"" (Certified Tribunal Record [CTR] page 797 at line 20; Applicant's Record [AR] pages 9-10 at para 19). It seems that the Applicant was trying to provide vague explanations to the RPD's questions. It was thus reasonable for the RPD to draw a negative credibility inference from the Applicant's explications and information before it. ",Credibility determinations by the RPD are afforded deference.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [11] As the Supreme Court noted in the Ward case previously cited, in order to demonstrate that state protection is not available, claimants have to do more than simply demonstrate that state protection is not perfect. That is, the fact that a government has not always succeeded in protecting people in the situation of a particular refugee claimant is not sufficient to establish that state protection is not available to the claimant in his or her home country.

In light of the rules set out by the Federal Court of Appeal in <TARGETCASE> , specifically regarding decision-making independence as a component of judicial independence, was the appointment of members holding a hearing by a coordinating member who had sat at the hearing of the first decision, quashed by the Federal Court Trial Division, which ordered a trial de novo, likely to create a reasonable apprehension of bias in a person who was reasonably well-informed about the matter? 2. Was the renewal of the mandate of a member at the hearing by the government, on the recommendation of the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, made when the said Minister was acting as a party in a proceeding before that member, likely to create a reasonable apprehension of bias in the mind of an informed person in light of the principles set out in <REFERENCE> , and <REFERENCE> ? 3. Does the fact that an administrative tribunal which has to dispose of a party's inculpatory allegations becomes financially involved for the benefit of the said party unknown to the opposing party, infringe the rules of judicial independence? 4. If a negative answer was given to each of these questions taken separately, is the fact that they were raised jointly in the same proceeding so likely to adversely affect judicial independence as to make the decision rendered null and void? ","Decision-making independence as a component of judicial independence requires that the appointment of members holding a hearing by a coordinating member who had sat at the hearing of the first decision, quashed by the Federal Court Trial Division, which ordered a trial de novo, should not create a reasonable apprehension of bias in a person who is reasonably well-informed about the matter."

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [128] Wetston J began by writing at paragraphs 34 and 35 of his Reasons: 34 As to the matter of timing, there are several points in the patent process which are of possible relevance to considerations of validity, including: the date of invention, the application date, the priority date, and the date the patent is issued. 35 The date of invention is presumed to be the filing date, or the date the original priority application was filed. However, an inventor is entitled to claim priority based on an invention date prior to the first filing date. Usually an inventor will claim an earlier date where a competing inventor is also seeking to obtain a patent, although the entitlement is not limited to these circumstances. The test for determining an earlier invention date is, ""the date at which the inventor can prove he has first formulated, either in writing or verbally, a description which affords the means of making that which is invented"": <TARGETCASE> at 456.

In the Court of Appeal, this decision was reversed and it was decided that the government's conduct justified the award of solicitor-client costs.

The general rule in this regard is that solicitor-client costs are awarded only on very rare occasions, for example when a party has displayed reprehensible, scandalous or outrageous conduct ( <REFERENCE> , at p. 134).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [10] The applicant alleged that she received a threatening phone call from the FARC in September 2001 demanding she pay them one million pesos. The Board found it curious that the alleged call came almost immediately following her return to Colombia from the United States. Given the timing of this call, it was reasonable for the Board to doubt the credibility of this allegation. Related to this finding is the admission the applicant made at the hearing: that the FARC did not impose a deadline for the extortion monies. It was reasonable for the Board to conclude that a deadline for payment is a ""crucial element of an extortion demand"" as the deadline serves to effectively trigger the threat. This was a conclusion grounded in common sense and rationality. <TARGETCASE> ",A deadline for payment is a crucial element of an extortion demand as it serves to effectively trigger the threat.

question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [55] The Applicants submit that the Officer used a factor that was supposed to militate towards granting the permanent residence from within Canada on H&C grounds - the degree of establishment - and used it against granting the exemption by noting that the minor applicants' successful establishment and integration in Canada meant that they would adapt quickly to a new environment if they were to be removed from Canada.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [178] At the start of the hearing the applicants applied to the delegates for an immediate stay of the disciplinary proceedings, submitting inter alia that under the Act the tribunal has no power of summoning or compelling witnesses to testify, and this accordingly creates a risk of infringing their right to a full answer and defence ( <TARGETCASE> O.A.C. 201; and <REFERENCE> B.C.A.C. 81; 62 W.A.C. 81).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [20] <TARGETCASE> (T.D.), Blais, J., distinguished <REFERENCE> , on the basis of three different grounds. The first one was that an immigration officer has a duty to disclose to the plaintiff a report which was prepared by a third party. In both Marjerbi , supra, and the present case, no report was filed by a third party. Second, Blais, J., stated that earlier decisions of this Court had been hesitant to impose on the immigration officer a duty to disclose to the plaintiff the content of his or her analysis of the risk of return. Finally, Blais, J., concluded that it was unusual to provide reasons to the parties for comments before the issuance of the decision. <REFERENCE> ","An immigration officer has a duty to disclose to the plaintiff a report prepared by a third party, there is hesitance to impose a duty on the officer to disclose their analysis of the risk of return, and it is unusual to provide reasons to the parties for comments before the issuance of the decision."

Under the federal scheme, those responsible for answering access to information requests are agents of a government institution. This is unlike the situation under many provincial access to information statutes, where information requests are reviewed by an administrative tribunal independent from the executive ... . A less differential standard of review thus advances the stated objective that decisions on the disclosure of government information be reviewed independently of government. Further, those charged with responding to requests under the federal Access Act might be inclined to interpret the exceptions to information disclosure in a liberal manner so as to favour their institution ... . As such, the exercise of broad powers of review would also advance the stated purpose of providing a right of access to information in records under the control of a government institution in accordance with the principle that necessary exceptions to the right of access should be limited and specific.""

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [37] The RPD therefore erred by finding, on a balance of probabilities, that there was no serious possibility of the applicant being persecuted in Lebanon and that alternative arrangements existed. On all of these points, the RPD failed to mention evidence that was so important to the case that it can be inferred from the failure to mention it in the reasons that it was actually omitted ( <TARGETCASE> A.C.W.S.

I do not understand s. 91, which provides for this grievance procedure, to limit the grievance officer to recommending only the observance of legally prescribed rights. This is, after all, not ""adjudication"" like the treatment of grievances under s. 92 of that Act .

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [13] It is true that the jurisprudence has fluctuated somewhat on this issue. The applicant relied in particular on REFERENCE , above, in which Justice Mandamin applied the correctness standard to the question of whether the adjudicator had erred in finding that he had jurisdiction to hear the respondent's unjust dismissal complaint, on the ground that the issue was jurisdiction.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [38] With regard to the CAIPS, the departmental computer based system, and the alleged, improper delegation, or fettering, of discretion, I note that it has been held that the CCDO is ""... a binding system of classification and assessment."" [see footnote 17] As a result, visa officers are bound by the CCDO definitions and may not substitute their own criteria for a given occupation. In the recent case of <TARGETCASE> a question on whether visa officers can delegate their authority to CAIPS, held that CAIPS ""... is simply an administrative procedure whereby the visa officer employs a processing system to assist her in making her assessment of the applicant."" In my view, there is no reviewable error where a visa officer uses CAIPS to arrive at an assessment figure for specific vocational preparation (SVP). Fettering Of Discretion And The Delhi Notes ",Visa officers can use the CAIPS processing system to assist in making assessments of applicants without it being considered a delegation of their authority.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [33] To conclude, this Court has held in previous decisions that a PRRA officer has no duty to disclose his or her decision regarding a PRRA application to the applicant where that officer also decides the humanitarian and compassionate application. More specifically, in <REFERENCE> Martineau, J., said that the PRRA officer had no duty to give the applicant an opportunity to make comments before reaching a final decision on her application ( <TARGETCASE> at para. 21; <REFERENCE> ; <REFERENCE> , supra, at para. 39; <REFERENCE> at para. 37; <REFERENCE> at para. 41).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [19] In this regard, the Québec Labour Code circumscribes the scope of permissible disclosure of otherwise relevant information and thus limits parties' procedural fairness rights in respect of such information. It is well-settled that common law procedural fairness rights may be limited by statute (so long as there is no violation of a party's constitutional rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Part I of the Constitution Act, 1982, being Schedule B to the Canada Act 1982 (UK), 1982, c 11) (see e.g. <REFERENCE> ; and <REFERENCE> ). And, as Justice Bich notes, a decision made in violation of a clear legislative provision is unreasonable. Syndicat des employés de Au dragon forgé can therefore be read as a case where the content of parties' procedural fairness rights were fixed by statute and the tribunal's interpretation of that statute was subject to reasonableness review, as is normally the case when a tribunal interprets a provision in its constituent statute ( <REFERENCE> at para 54; <REFERENCE> ; and Alberta (Information and <TARGETCASE> ). ","The content of parties' procedural fairness rights can be fixed by statute and a tribunal's interpretation of that statute is subject to reasonableness review, especially when a tribunal interprets a provision in its constituent statute."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [15] The Applicant also raised, as a matter of procedural fairness, the absence of any notice of the Officer's concern about the Applicant's work experience. It is well established law that where a visa officer's concern relates to the requirements set out in the legislation, the officer is under no obligation to apprise an applicant of those concerns ( <TARGETCASE> ). However, in this case, it was the Respondent's position that the letter requesting the Applicant to update her employment information and to file a letter of reference was in fact notice to her of concerns with respect to the evidence both as to experience and occupational classifications. ","Where a visa officer's concern relates to the requirements set out in the legislation, the officer is under no obligation to apprise an applicant of those concerns."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [44] The owner of the trademark has the exclusive right to its use, in association with the designated wares, throughout Canada. There is no more reason to limit the use of that right to certain market segments than to geographic regions. In TARGETCASE my colleague Justice Dubé provided the same overall market protection to Fabergé's trademark ""Eminence"" when he stated: REFERENCE Although he was considering the likelihood of confusion and not s. 19 specifically, his conclusion can readily be applied to the facts of this case. Here, the affidavit of the vice-president of Luxo suggests that the company may extend its presence beyond the hair salon and barber shop market to the drug store and mass merchandising sectors. [see footnote 31] ","The owner of the trademark has the exclusive right to its use, in association with the designated wares, throughout Canada without limitation to certain market segments or geographic regions."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [49] In my view, this is not a procedural fairness issue. The Fairness Letter and the Applicant's response make it clear that the reason for the refusal was explained to the Applicant in sufficient detail to allow him to understand why his application was refused. It was then up to the Applicant to take whatever advice he needed and suggest a solution that would avoid an excessive demand upon the public system. The Applicant's response indicates that he knew this would involve alternative insurance coverage, but he does not say how and where this will be provided. The resolution he comes up with is a suggestion or declaration of intent. It is not a plan. It is inchoate.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [21] The applicant argues that this cannot be the case because it results in the officer fettering her discretion to an earlier decision made by a different tribunal. In support of his submission, the applicant cites <TARGETCASE> (F.C.A.). In those cases, this Court ruled that the Adjudication Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board constituted under the former Immigration Act fettered its discretion by adopting a previous exclusion decision made by either this Court or the CRDD. However, Zazai and Varela are distinguished from the case at bar because paragraph 15(b) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations, SOR/2002-227 was not engaged on the facts. The Court <REFERENCE> cited Mr. Justice Frederick Gibson’s reasons <REFERENCE> , where he stated at paragraph 23: ¶ 23 I am satisfied that it is beyond doubt that neither the former paragraph 19(1)(j) of the Act, nor the re-enactment of that paragraph, provides any direction to an Adjudicator that an earlier decision of the Convention Refugee Determination Division to exclude an individual from Convention refugee status […] is determinative of an issue before the Adjudicator […] If Parliament had intended that an earlier decision of the CRDD be binding on the Adjudicator, it could easily have said so.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [26] The task of the Court in interpreting legislation is comprised of more than one step. The Court must first look at the words; do these words have a plain and ordinary meaning or is there ambiguity or lack of clarity? Secondly, the context of the legislation must be examined. What is the history of the provision in question? What is the scheme of the statute? What is its object? What policy considerations were in the mind of Parliament or, in the case of regulations, the Governor in Council? This second part of the analysis could warrant a variation from the grammatical and ordinary sense of the word. And, regardless of how clear and unambiguous the words of a provision may be, the further analysis must be carried out. Indeed, a failure to determine the intention of the legislature in enacting a particular provision has been found, by the Supreme Court of Canada, to be an error ( <REFERENCE> , at paragraphs 23, 31). It follows that, where there are conflicting but not unreasonable interpretations available, the contextual framework of the legislation becomes even more important. <TARGETCASE> What obligations are on Apotex to put forward evidence? <REFERENCE> ","Regardless of how clear and unambiguous the words of a provision may be, the intention of the legislature must be determined, and failure to do so is an error."

Like Justice Shore, Justice Roy drew a parallel between the RAD's scheme and the legislative scheme reviewed in <TARGETCASE> , above, and, after analyzing the legislative debates relating to the creation of the RAD, he found that it exercises an appellate function and jurisdiction, not a role of judicial review. However, Justice Roy indicates that an appeal does not mean a new trial or a reconsideration of the matter in its entirety and that the standard applicable during any appeal should also be applicable to RAD appeals: [translation] ","The RAD exercises an appellate function and jurisdiction, not a role of judicial review, and the standard applicable during any appeal should also be applicable to RAD appeals."

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [35] As for the applicants' submissions that they did not file a complaint because the one filed by Mr. Fernando Quintero Cienfuegos' father had not been followed up, the Board was correct in finding that this was not sufficient to rebut the presumption of state protection. This Court has repeatedly stated that evidence that one or more police officers refused to act on a refugee claimant's complaint or that an investigation led nowhere is not sufficient. That cannot be the basis for automatically finding that state protection is not available ( <REFERENCE> A.C.W.S. (3d) 626 at para. 15-17; <TARGETCASE> A.C.W.S.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [12] The difficulty is that Madam Justice Snider's decision has subsequently been used as authority for the proposition that, although actual prejudice need not be shown, errors in interpretation must be material. In my view, this is a questionable proposition because, in the context of interpretation errors, ""material"" and ""prejudicial"" appear to have been given the same meaning; that is, a negative impact on the Board's decision. The line of cases which have adopted this proposition include: TARGETCASE, Madam Justice Gleason concluded at paragraph 26, correctly in my view, that ""once an applicant establishes that there was a real and significant translation errors, he or she is not required to also demonstrate that the error underpinned a key finding before the RPD decision can be set aside"".

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [28] Once again in <REFERENCE> , Mr. Justice Bastarache wrote at pages 1023 and 1024: <TARGETCASE> ""Using a textual analysis of the Convention itself, and taking account of the views of commentators, La Forest, J., at p. 733, [in <REFERENCE> ] defines the purpose of the Convention with reference to the specific issue of the definition of refugee, which is precisely the issue in this case as well. <REFERENCE> 'Underlying the Convention is the international community's commitment to the assurance of basic human rights without discrimination. This is indicated in the preamble to the treaty as follow: <REFERENCE> ""Considering that the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights approved on 10 December 1948 by the General Assembly have affirmed the principle that human beings shall enjoy fundamental rights and freedoms without discrimination. <REFERENCE> 'This theme outlines the boundaries of the objectives sought to be achieved and consented to by the delegates.","The purpose of the Convention is the international community's commitment to the assurance of basic human rights without discrimination, particularly in the context of defining a refugee."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [15] The same may be said of their third ground advanced in support of this application for judicial review. Contrary to what the applicants assert, the Board did not apply the wrong test in conducting its state protection analysis and thus this case is distinguishable from <TARGETCASE> ACWS (3d) 644, relied on by the applicants. When its decision is read in entirety, it is clear that the Board considered the efficacy of the efforts undertaken by the Czech Republic to assist the Roma as opposed to the mere fact that it had passed laws or was making other attempts to address discrimination faced by its Romani citizens. It citied several incidents of prosecutions, programs and laws, noting that some progress was being made to address the discrimination the Roma have faced in that country. The RPD, therefore, applied the correct test and the first basis for the challenge to the reasonableness of its state protection determination must fail. <REFERENCE> ","The Board did not apply the wrong test in conducting its state protection analysis and considered the efficacy of the efforts undertaken by the Czech Republic to assist the Roma, not just the fact that it had passed laws or was making other attempts to address discrimination."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [94] As outlined above, this confuses the reasons for targeting with the risk itself ( <REFERENCE> , above, at para 13; <REFERENCE> , above, at para 29; <TARGETCASE> , above, at para 29). The original motivation of the gang in targeting Mr. Correa (extortion) does not define his risk. Rather, the Board was obligated to look at his present risk in both nature and degree and determine if it is fundamentally the same or different from that faced by the population generally, or some significant sub-group. The fact that this risk may have stemmed from extortion is irrelevant, except to the extent that it helps to objectively assess the nature and degree of the risk. Mr. Correa faced a risk that he and his family would be killed because he had refused the gang's demands and reported them to police. Business owners faced a risk that they would be extorted. The general population faced a risk that various demands (on pain of violence) would be made of them by various gangs. These are not the same risks. As outlined above, determining whether a risk is the same requires consideration of both the nature and the degree of the risk ( <REFERENCE> , above, at para 8; <REFERENCE> , above, at para 111; De La <REFERENCE> , at para 41). ","The original motivation of the gang in targeting an individual does not define his risk, rather, the Board should assess the present risk in both nature and degree and determine if it is fundamentally the same or different from that faced by the population generally, or some significant sub-group."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [9] It is axiomatic that a court exercising judicial review authority over a tribunal is to accord deference to findings of fact, as well as to questions of interpretation where the tribunal is interpreting its home statute: REFERENCE ; REFERENCE. Further, a reviewing court is to read the decision below with a view to upholding it; perfection in the reasons is not the standard of review. TARGETCASE teaches that a reviewing court inquires into the qualities that make a decision reasonable, ""referring both to the process of articulating the reasons and to outcomes."" As Justice Abella wrote in REFERENCE, the reasons ""must be read together with the outcome and serve the purpose of showing whether the result falls within the range of acceptable outcomes."" The reasons, when read as a whole and in the context of the record, must demonstrate the reasonableness of the decision. ","A reviewing court inquires into the qualities that make a decision reasonable, referring both to the process of articulating the reasons and to outcomes."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [11] The respondent is correct: the applicants have failed to prove how their legal counsel's behavior at the time of the hearing prejudiced them. While the circumstances of this case are very different than the cases relied on by the applicants, these cases do establish that the incompetence of counsel at the hearing can result in a denial of a fair hearing and provides grounds for judicial review on the basis of a breach of natural justice ( <REFERENCE> , above at para 11). Thus, where by no fault of the applicant, counsel's misconduct results in the applicant being denied the opportunity to a hearing, a reviewable breach occurs ( <REFERENCE> , above at para 11; <REFERENCE> , above). However, the applicants were not denied a hearing: their refugee claim proceeded. Thus, in such a case, the Board's decision can only be reviewed where extraordinary circumstances are proven, such that ""there is sufficient evidence to establish the 'exact dimensions of the problem'"" ( <REFERENCE> , above at para 12). Thereby, where the incompetence or negligence of counsel is sufficiently specific and supported by the evidence, such behavior is inherently prejudicial to the applicants, resulting in a denial of a fair hearing ( <TARGETCASE> , above at para 12). However, the applicants have not adduced any such evidence. ","Where the incompetence or negligence of counsel is sufficiently specific and supported by the evidence, such behavior is inherently prejudicial to the applicants, resulting in a denial of a fair hearing."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [67] As explained above, this Court intends to assess the danger to the security of Canada as it was defined by the Supreme Court of Canada in TARGETCASE, supra, and to review the public and confidential evidence, keeping in mind that the Ministers have the initial burden to establish the danger. The facts must be that the evidence of danger is serious, grounded in an objectively reasonable suspicion, and that the potential harm resulting from the said danger is substantial rather than negligible (see REFERENCE, supra, at paragraph 90). The weighing of the evidence, if the burden is met, is to be performed according to the standard of ""reasonable grounds to believe"", as it was clearly said by the Supreme Court of Canada in REFERENCE. ","The danger to the security of Canada is defined as evidence of danger that is serious, grounded in an objectively reasonable suspicion, and the potential harm resulting from the danger is substantial rather than negligible."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [22] The respondent says that the standard of review is reasonableness and argues that the applicants failed to provide documentary evidence on country conditions to rebut the presumption of adequate state protection. The respondent then summarized the law on state protection and noted that the applicants are required to submit reliable and probative evidence that proves, on a balance of probabilities, that state protection is lacking or inadequate (see Canada (Minister of Citizenship and <REFERENCE> ). <TARGETCASE> ","The applicants are required to submit reliable and probative evidence that proves, on a balance of probabilities, that state protection is lacking or inadequate."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [48] In this case, the Court has no choice but to find that a signature is lacking. Although the parties have confirmed before this Court that the plaintiff submitted other bids to the defendant that include the same clause, there is nothing in the evidence to support a finding that the bids submitted after April 2007 were signed.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [6] The original stay having been issued pursuant to the Immigration Act , the Board continues to assess the applicant's case pursuant to s. 70(1) (b). The Board recognizes its wide discretion to consider all the factors of the case, and indeed lists the numerous factors that ""guided"" its decision; however, the Board's reasons focus on the fact that since her previous stay the applicant has breached several of the conditions imposed on her: <TARGETCASE> ""The panel concludes that the appellant is in breach of a number of conditions of the stay of her removal order. She has been convicted of further criminal offences contrary to condition #4. She has not made reasonable efforts to maintain herself in such a condition that it is not likely she will commit further offences contrary to #11.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [26] In REFERENCE relied on TARGETCASE and expressed the view that the RAD scheme functions as an appeal de novo . Yet he recognized the need for deference when credibility is at issue (para 37).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [19] To this I would add the admonition of Justice Evans, sitting in this Court, in <TARGETCASE> (T.D.), that only in very clear cases should a court be prepared to dismiss an application for judicial review on a preliminary motion for lack of standing. At paragraph 25, Justice Evans cautioned that at a preliminary stage the Court may not have the benefit of full legal argument and that, to the extent that the strength of the applicant's case is relevant to the ground of discretionary standing, the Court may not be in a position to make a fully informed decision that would justify a denial of standing. At paragraph 39, he wrote: ""However, when the question of standing is raised in a preliminary motion, such as is the case here, a court should not subject the strength of an applicant's claim to a level of scrutiny that probes more deeply than considering whether, on the materials before the court, the applicant has a fairly arguable case or, putting it the other way, has no reasonable cause of action: <REFERENCE> demonstrate that the applicant fails to satisfy even this low threshold test.""

After reviewing the documentary evidence, the officer concluded that adequate state protection existed in both Ecuador and Venezuela. The officer was of the view that any risk faced by the applicants did not amount to unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship. <REFERENCE> - The officer noted that the applicants did not have any family living in Canada, but did acknowledge the collection of letters submitted by their friends and co-workers. <TARGETCASE> - The officer noted that Mr. Rodriguez Zambrano failed to provide updated information as to when he began his employment, whether he continued to be employed, or whether he had sought other employment opportunities.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [27] The standard of proof required to establish ""reasonable grounds"" is more than a flimsy suspicion, but less than the civil test of balance of probabilities [see footnote 9].

In the majority decision, the Court found that the family's ability to pay was a relevant factor when assessing for permanent resident status. The Court found that the ""investor"" and ""self-employed"" categories under which the applicants qualified for admission, to a large extent, concerned the individual's assets, and, thus, it would seem incongruous to interpret the legislation in such a way that the very assets that qualify these individuals for admission to Canada could be ignored in determining admissibility of their disabled child.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [13] Conversely, the second-step involves an exercise of discretion and a weighing of relevant factors to determine whether special circumstances warrant the non-application of issue estoppel in this case. Discretionary factors attract a more deferential review ( <REFERENCE> at paras. 34-37). Therefore, patent unreasonableness is the appropriate standard of review for the second-step.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [38] In any event, the applicants have not adequately proved non-feasance on the part of their former representative. In certain circumstances, non-feasance by an applicant's counsel can amount to a breach of natural justice ( <REFERENCE> ). However, if an applicant is to be successful in making an argument based on counsel's non-feasance, a certain evidentiary burden must be met. Justice Pelletier in <REFERENCE> A.C.W.S.(3d) 303 (T.D.), at para. 19 ( <TARGETCASE> ) indicated: "" I am not prepared to accept an allegation of serious professional misconduct against a member of the bar and an officer of this court without having the member's explanation for the conduct in question or evidence that the matter has been referred to the governing body for investigation. In this case, there was ample opportunity to do one or the other but neither was done. The failure to do so is inconsistent with the gravity of the allegations made. This is not a question of being solicitous of lawyers' interests at the expense of their clients. It is a question of recognizing that allegations of professional negligence are easily made and, if accepted, generally result in the relief sought being granted. The proof offered in support of such an allegation should be commensurate with the serious nature of the consequences for all concerned."" (Emphasis added) ","If an applicant alleges non-feasance by their counsel, they must provide evidence of the misconduct or show that the matter has been referred to the governing body for investigation."

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [38] The Applicant, citing TARGETCASE, claims that ""an officer has a duty to consult the most recent sources of information and is not limited to materials furnished by the applicant"". In REFERENCE , however, Mr. Justice Mosley was reviewing both a PRRA decision and an H&C decision, and it was with respect to the PRRA decision that this principle appliesREFERENCE). No such duty applies in respect of an H&C decision, for which the ""applicant has the burden of adducing proof of any claim on which the H & C application relies.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [16] When documentation submitted by an applicant is considered insufficient, does it necessarily mean that, as argued by the applicant, her or his credibility is at issue? Justice Russel Zinn's comments in <TARGETCASE> deal with this question albeit in a slightly different context where the decision maker was looking at a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment application. The same principles apply to the weighing of evidence in the present context. Among other things, the learned judge notes that a trier of fact may give little probative value to documentary evidence which is found to be unreliable because its author is not credible or simply because it falls into a category such as self-serving reports, to which lesser weight is given in the absence of corroborative evidence. In that respect, he says at paragraph 27: Evidence tendered by a witness with a personal interest in the matter may also be examined for its weight before considering its credibility because typically this sort of evidence requires corroboration if it is to have probative value.","A trier of fact may give little probative value to documentary evidence which is found to be unreliable because its author is not credible or because it falls into a category such as self-serving reports, which require corroboration to have probative value."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [12] Besides the preliminary issue, VIA insists that the Tribunal's decision is laden with errors of jurisdiction, law and fact and must be quashed. In contrast, the Commission and Mr. Mills, represented by counsel for the union, argue that the Tribunal's decision was reasonable, consistent with the evidence and correct in law. Both respondents, the Commission and the union, highlight the deference owed to the Tribunal in its determination of questions of fact. There is a two-step process for granting judicial review against findings of fact under s. 18.1(4)(d) of the Federal Court Act , R.S.C. 1985, c. C-7. First, the court must be satisfied that the Tribunal made an erroneous finding of fact. Second, even if the court concludes that the Tribunal was mistaken, it must also determine that the finding was made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard to the material before it. In contrast, the standard of review for questions of law is not reasonableness, but correctness: <TARGETCASE> . <REFERENCE> ","The standard of review for questions of law is not reasonableness, but correctness."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [31] According to the Respondent, the IAD is authorized to consider all of the evidence before it that it finds credible or trustworthy. Section 67 of the Act requires the IAD to consider ""all the circumstances of the case"" when deciding whether there are sufficient H&C considerations to warrant special relief from a removal order. Also, section 175 of the Act provides that the IAD is not bound by any legal or technical rules of evidence and that it may receive and base a decision on evidence adduced in the proceedings that it considers credible or trustworthy in the circumstances: <REFERENCE> ""175(1) The Immigration Appeal Division, in any proceeding before it, <REFERENCE> (a) must, in the case of an appeal under subsection 63(4), hold a hearing; <REFERENCE> (b) is not bound by any legal or technical rules of evidence; <REFERENCE> (c) may receive and base a decision on evidence adduced in the proceedings that it considers credible or trustworthy in the circumstances. <REFERENCE> <REFERENCE> ""175(1) Dans toute affaire don't elle est saisie, la Section d'appel de l'immigration: <REFERENCE> (a) dispose de l'appel formé au titre du paragraphe 63(4) par la tenue d'une audience; <REFERENCE> (b) n'est pas liée par les règles légales ou techniques de présentation de la preuve; <REFERENCE> (c) peut recevoir les éléments qu'elle juge crédibles ou dignes de foi en l'occurrence et fonder sur eux sa décision. <TARGETCASE> ",The Immigration Appeal Division is not bound by any legal or technical rules of evidence and may base a decision on evidence it considers credible or trustworthy in the circumstances.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: The respondent submitted that in <REFERENCE> ""likely to happen at any moment without warning"" and ""the injury might occur before the hazard could be removed"" to define danger under the Code . The respondent submitted that subsequent jurisprudence held that ""a narrower interpretation of imminent danger is called for and the right to refuse is primarily intended to deal with safety or health concerns which arise from day to day rather than a 'last resort' to bring existing disputes to a head"" ( <REFERENCE> the Code was amended in 1985 removing the concept of ""imminent"" from the work refusal provisions and adding a definition of ""danger"". The respondent submitted that the definition had two components: (1) the expectation of danger had to be reasonable, and (2) the danger had to be expected to cause injury or illness before the hazard or condition could be corrected. The respondent submitted that the 1985 definition was considered in <TARGETCASE> changed as a result of the removal of the word imminent.","The definition of danger under the Code has two components: the expectation of danger must be reasonable, and the danger must be expected to cause injury or illness before the hazard or condition can be corrected."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [36] PSAC submits, therefore, that the Commission's decision should be given less deference on judicial review for two reasons. First, section 41 of the CHRA creates a presumption in favour of proceeding to the investigative stage, given that ""the Commission shall deal with any complaint filed with it unless [...]"" one of the listed exceptions applies. Second, due to the preliminary and summary nature of section 41, a screening decision to dismiss a complaint should be treated with a higher degree of scrutiny than a decision to accept it, as a dismissal constitutes a final determination of the complainant's rights ( <TARGETCASE> NR 257 [ <REFERENCE> ]; <REFERENCE> Admin LR (4th) 255 [ <REFERENCE> ]; <REFERENCE> NR 121).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [76] Similarly, it is my view, that the respondent misconstrued the Supreme Court's decision in <REFERENCE> . In <TARGETCASE> , the issue was whether the Province of British Columbia's ""refusal to fund a particular treatment for preschool-aged autistic children violates the right to equality"" under s. 15 of the Charter : <REFERENCE> at para. 1.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: <REFERENCE> - Determinative Test: There is no determinative test as to whether there is a ""genuine issue"" for trial. The Court must not consider whether a party cannot possibly succeed at trial, but whether the case is so doubtful that it does not deserve consideration by a trier of fact at a future trial. In the context of patent infringement actions, the issues and facts are often complex and interwoven. In this case, there are at least two issues which need to be determined: (1) what is the construction of the patent; and (2) was the patent, as construed, anticipated by the prior art? On both of these issues, there is contradictory evidence presented by the Plaintiffs and Defendants which needs to be weighed. <TARGETCASE> - Credibility: As in the case at hand, where there will be expert witness testimony, there are often issues with respect to credibility, and contradictory evidence.","In cases with expert witness testimony, there are often issues with respect to credibility and contradictory evidence."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [145] I agree with respondents' counsel assessment that Mr. Velshi's comments to the press were no more than ""unfortunate expressions of opinion"". They were not made by a ""federal board, commission or other tribunal"" empowered to exercise statutory authority and must be read in the context provided by the legislative scheme. While one might hope that a ministerial aide would exercise greater restraint in purporting to speak on behalf of the government, his comments to the press amount to little more than posturing. As the Federal Court of Appeal has held, such remarks may be construed as nothing more than an excess of confidence in the strength of the case: <TARGETCASE> (F.C.A.) at para. 31. Here, there appears also to have been an intent to gain some political advantage from publicly condemning Galloway.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [20] The tribunal next referred to the Ribic factors approved by the Supreme Court of Canada, in <TARGETCASE> ( Chieu ), as factors which should be taken into consideration when evaluating and assessing the evidence in an application for discretionary relief to stay the removal of a permanent resident of Canada for humanitarian and compassionate considerations. Those factors are: a. The degree of establishment in Canada including employment and skills training; b. The reasons for leaving <REFERENCE> to Canada at the first opportunity; e. The family support available in Canada; f. The impact that the removal has on a person and his family; g. The hardship which the appellant would suffer if he was removed from Canada.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [35] The definition of unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship comes from IP 5: Immigrant Applications in Canada made on Humanitarian or Compassionate Grounds. This definition has been recognized and applied in case law.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [50] The IAD cited <REFERENCE> for the proposition that there are no exceptions to the duty to disclose the existence of family members. It is the Court's conclusion that the IAD was correct in citing <REFERENCE> because its holding regarding the duty to disclose was correct, especially in light of the aforementioned ruling in <REFERENCE> . The IAD in <REFERENCE> aptly expresses the operation of paragraph 117(9)( d ) of the Regulations in the following terms, ""[t] his is a strict question of the application of fact to law. The panel finds as proven that the applicant is the biological child of the appellant born prior to his immigration to Canada. He was not declared on his application for permanent residence"" ( <TARGETCASE> at para. 33). It is the Court's conclusion that these factors operated to exclude the applicant's son from obtaining membership in the Family Class in <REFERENCE> and the same factors operate to exclude Mr. Nguyen's daughter in this case. Did the IAD commit a reviewable error by failing to take into consideration the importance of family reunification, as enumerated in subsection 3(1) of the <REFERENCE> and the best interests of the child as per the CIC's IP 5 Manual and the guiding principles of the Convention on the Rights of the Child ?

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [44] The expert for Biovail, Dr. Mathiowitz, was unable to contradict the idea that, for Claim 1, the surfactant had to be placed in the active layer of the microgranule. Dr. Mathiowitz is uncertain of whether the surfactant must be in the active layer to be effective, but does agree that, for the purposes of Claim 1, the surfactant must be in the active layer to be described by the claim (see Rhoxal's Motion Record, Tab 6 page 310 and Tab 8, page 398).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [21] Moreover, it is important to specify at the outset that this Court's jurisdiction to know matters submitted before it is not dependent on the applicable law, at least as regards the main action, unlike the situation that would prevail if both parties to the dispute were private parties. In such a context, the Federal Court could not be concerned with a dispute unless it is truly a matter of maritime law, under section 22 of the Federal Courts Act and section 101 of the Constitution Act , 1867 , as interpreted by such decisions as <REFERENCE> ( Quebec North Shore ) and <TARGETCASE> ( McNamara Construction ). In this case, Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada is a party to the dispute insofar as it was Public Works that sold the vessel to the applicant. Moreover, it is not in dispute that the Federal Court exercises concurrent jurisdiction for any claim against the federal government, both in contractual and tort law: see the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act , section 21 and the Federal Courts Act , section 17.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [32] In general, the provisions of the Act embody the well-known proposition that the state grants an exclusive privilege for a new and useful invention in exchange for adequate consideration in the form of a description of the invention. The description of the invention must be sufficient both to allow others to determine what the patent covers and to enable those skilled in the relevant art to exploit the invention on behalf of society after the patent expires. As Mr. Justice Lamer, as he then was, observed in <REFERENCE> C.P.R.(3d) 257, at p. 266 <TARGETCASE> : ""In Canada the granting of a patent means the kind of contract between the Crown and the inventor in which the latter receives an exclusive right to exploit his invention for a certain period in exchange for complete disclosure to the public of the invention and the way in which it operates. The state of Canadian patent law may be summarized as follows, adopting the observations of Harold G. Fox, Canadian Patent Law and Practice Relating to Letters Patent for Inventions , 4th Ed.","In Canada, the granting of a patent is a contract between the Crown and the inventor, where the inventor receives an exclusive right to exploit his invention for a certain period in exchange for complete disclosure to the public of the invention and the way it operates."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [68] The Applicant's assertion that the Minister ""may draw no adverse inferences from the silence of the Applicant"" is similarly predicated on a conflation of criminal law standards of proof and due process rights and the ITOA legislative framework and the Minister's Role in the ITOA context. While the confessions rule does prevent one's silence in respect of criminal charges to be used against him or her in respect of a finding of criminal liability, this presumption does not apply in respect of the determination and administration of a sentence for a criminal offence. In fact, the Criminal Code , RSC 1985, c C-46, section 718, identifies the ""promot[ion of] a sense of responsibility in offenders, and acknowledgement of the harm done to victims and to the community"" as an objective tied to the fundamental purpose of sentencing. Moreover, an offender's expression of remorse, timely plea of guilty, and cooperation with authorities when apprehended are all regarded as mitigating factors in respect of sentence length ( Criminal Code , s 718.2; <TARGETCASE> at para 63). ","An offender's expression of remorse, timely plea of guilty, and cooperation with authorities when apprehended are all regarded as mitigating factors in respect of sentence length."

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [28] While not binding on this Court, the UNHCR Handbook is a useful starting point in trying to interpret the Convention . As Justice Gérard La Forest stated in <TARGETCASE> , above, at paragraph 46, it ""must be treated as a highly relevant authority in considering refugee admission practices"".

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [19] Since the applicant claimed that she feared that as a woman she would be targeted for rape <REFERENCE> , the Board is expected to have considered the evidence with respect to her membership in a particular social group, namely women <REFERENCE> or more specifically, Haitian women returning to Haiti from abroad.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [128] I agree with counsel for Lilly that this case is not relied upon as an authority or in support of a legal principle, but rather as evidence to prove a key fact in relation to one of the questions to be decided by this Court. As such, Mylan should have disclosed that decision in its NOA if it intended to rely upon it. Indeed, none of the affidavits filed by Mylan in this proceeding refer to the TARGETCASE decision. Therefore, this evidence is not properly before this Court and will not be considered. This Court has to decide the case at bar on the basis of the facts, the evidence and the expert testimony before it. In any event, there is no need to rely on that case to conclude that Lilly has submitted no evidence to show that it is more likely than not that the milling process will not only reduce the tadalafil particle size, but will do so significantly enough to bring it within the claims of the '948 Patent.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [19] <REFERENCE> the question was whether the Québec Court of King's Bench (appeal side) had the power to grant leave to appeal per saltum to the Supreme Court which was given to the highest court having final jurisdiction in the province.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [14] In my view, the Minister's description of the appeal process as a ""full fact-based appeal"" means that neither judicial review nor the traditional appellate review for ""palpable or overriding error"" described by Mr. Justice Shore in <TARGETCASE> are models for the RAD in the IRPA . <REFERENCE> ",The appeal process as a 'full fact-based appeal' means that neither judicial review nor the traditional appellate review for 'palpable or overriding error' are models for the RAD in the IRPA.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [19] The Applicant says that the Officer had to consult the most recent documentary evidence, and it was wrong to dismiss such evidence just because it did not personally name the Applicant. This evidence described risks faced by people of the Applicant's ethnicity, gender, and perceived political opinion, and it had to be considered.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [25] In this case, the Applicant relies on Khan and Patel to argue that because visa officers' decisions have previously been reviewed on the correctness standard, the same standard should be applied to this matter. However, both of those cases were decided prior to the jurisprudential development regarding the deference to be afforded to decisions of Ministers arising from the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in <REFERENCE> (at para 63). An issue may be revisited when the standard is incompatible with subsequent jurisprudential developments ( <REFERENCE> at para 35; <TARGETCASE> at para 48).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [16] Secondly, in applying the pragmatic and functional approach, where the impugned decision is considered globally and as a whole, the applicable standard of review should be reasonableness simpliciter ( <REFERENCE> at para. 24; <TARGETCASE> at para. 7). That being said, where a particular finding of fact is made by the PRRA Officer, the Court should not substitute its decision to that of the PRRA Officer unless such finding of fact was made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard to the material before the PRRA Officer (paragraph 18.1(4)(d) of the Federal Courts Act , R.S.C. 1985, c.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [35] The Respondents emphasize the importance of not aborting security investigations undertaken in the context of permanent residence applications ( <TARGETCASE> [ <REFERENCE> ]). In the present case, there are legitimate concerns about the Applicant's involvement with the LTTE and the poison pen letters made specific, concrete allegations that required further investigation. The Respondents also argue that the Applicant's story through which he obtained refugee status may have contained significant misrepresentations, which may support an application to vacate that status. This would remove the foundation for his permanent residence application.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: In my opinion, however, this is foreclosed by the legislative initiative which overtook the existing common law in Ontario and established a different regime which does not exclude the courts but rather makes them part of the enforcement machinery under the Code .

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [38] Curiously enough, a provision which speaks directly to this issue is buried in the Immigration Regulations, 1978 (the "" Regulations ""). Section 5(2) of the Regulations , which defines who may sponsor another's application for permanent landing, contains the following clause: <REFERENCE> ""(c) in the case of a permanent resident, the person is not subject to a removal order or a conditional removal order, other than a removal order that is of no effect because the person has, after the date of the order, been granted lawful permission to establish permanent residence in Canada; <TARGETCASE> <REFERENCE> ""c) dans le cas d'un résident permanent, il n'est pas visé par une mesure de renvoi ou une mesure de renvoi conditionnel, autre qu'une mesure de renvoi qui ne peut être exécutée en raison d'une admission légale ubséquente au Canada à titre de résident permanent; <REFERENCE> It is eminently sensible that one who has acquired the right to stay in Canada cannot at the same time be subject to an order requiring him/her to leave Canada.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [48] As mentioned above at page 3 in the case at bar, unlike <REFERENCE> and <TARGETCASE> above, the officer examined the evidence and made a determination based on that evidence that the applicant had committed the offence of abetting personation. Specifically, she relied on the fact that the applicant was found escorting the impostor, that the applicant and the impostor's tickets were booked and purchased together, that the applicant did not have a consistent explanation for how he knew the impostor or why he was traveling with her, and that the applicant was found with documents in other people's names in his baggage when he returned to Canada.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [10] I agree with the Minister that the determination, by the RAD, of the appropriate analysis for the admissibility of new evidence under section 110 of the IRPA involves a tribunal considering and applying its home statute, thus attracting more deference than a correctness standard ( <REFERENCE> [ <REFERENCE> ]; Alberta (Information and <TARGETCASE> ).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [12] Some decisions state that the correctness standard applies, either because the issue is one of central importance to the legal system and outside of the RAD's expertise, or because it affects the jurisdictional lines between the RPD and the RAD (e.g. REFERENCE; REFERENCE; REFERENCE). Other cases disagree and say that it is no more than a question of interpreting the RAD's home statute, which presumptively attracts the reasonableness standard (TARGETCASE; REFERENCE; REFERENCE; REFERENCE).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [38] The Respondent argues the Officer's evaluation of the Applicant's ability to become economically established in Canada was reasonable.

This implementation may occur in various ways and there is no basis for thinking that in s. 61.5 [now ss. 240-246] the legislator intended to cover only one of them, even if that one was the most simple, direct or usual. Of course, the adjudicator must have before him a dismissal, that is to say, the employer's actions must disclose a definite intention to unilaterally terminate the contract of employment (and that is all that was at the basis of the decision in Eskasoni School Board , supra), but once this is established there is in our opinion no question as to his jurisdiction.'","An essential precondition to an Adjudicator's jurisdiction under Rule 242 is for the complainant to establish that he or she has been dismissed, and the employer's actions must disclose a definite intention to unilaterally terminate the contract of employment."

Two, by examining the evidence adduced before the adjudicator, both oral and documentary, to ascertain whether or not that evidence was sufficient to establish that the essential ingredients of the offence in Canada had been proven in the foreign proceedings, whether precisely described in the initiating documents or in the statutory provisions in the same words or not.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [121] Following his consideration of the origins and nature of judicial independence, Lamer, C.J., reviewed and expanded on certain aspects of the decision in <REFERENCE> and ... the two dimensions of judicial independence"" outlined by <REFERENCE> judicial independence --- security of tenure, financial security, and administrative independence -- should be contrasted with what I have termed the two dimensions of judicial independence. In <REFERENCE> , Le Dain, J., drew a distinction between two dimensions of judicial independence, the individual independence of a judge and the institutional or collective independence of the court or tribunal of which that judge is a member. In other words, while individual independence attaches to individual judges, institutional or collective independence attaches to the court or tribunal as an institutional entity. The two different dimensions of judicial independence are related in the following way ( <TARGETCASE> , supra, at p. 687): 'The relationship between these two aspects of judicial independence is that an individual judge may enjoy the essential conditions of judicial independence but if the court or tribunal over which he or she presides is not independent of the other branches of government, in what is essential to its function, he or she cannot be said to be an independent tribunal.' ""","An individual judge may enjoy the essential conditions of judicial independence but if the court or tribunal over which he or she presides is not independent of the other branches of government, in what is essential to its function, he or she cannot be said to be an independent tribunal."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [21] However, this Court has also considered undue delay in processing a claim to be a ""special reason"" which would justify an award of costs: see, for example, <REFERENCE> , above, at para. 60; <TARGETCASE> ",Undue delay in processing a claim can be a 'special reason' justifying an award of costs.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [71] Furthermore, damages may be compensatory or punitive according to whether they are awarded as a measure of the actual loss suffered by the plaintiff or as punishment for outrageous conduct and to deter future transgressions by the defendant. While an accounting of profits might serve to dissuade a defendant from perusing its improper course of conduct, punishment does not play a role in its award. As an equitable remedy, its entire rationale is to redress wrongs, not to administer punishment. <TARGETCASE> (H.C.), at p. 160, the court noted ""the object of the inquiry was to compensate the plaintiff, and not to punish the defendants"". Accordingly, if the plaintiffs intention in the present case was that ""Valmet should be punished"", as stated in cross-examination by Beloit's Senior Vice-President, Mr. Hauser, the proper remedy to seek would have been punitive damages. However, based on the evidence it is highly doubtful such a claim would have succeeded. ","The object of an accounting of profits is to compensate the plaintiff, not to punish the defendants."

In addition, in <REFERENCE> (T.D.), Mr. Justice MacKay dealt with essentially the same circumstances as those discussed by Mr. Justice Rothstein in <TARGETCASE> .

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [92] However, I don't agree that the implication which flows from such a conclusion is that the rights of the other applicants under s. 2 of the Charter were breached. To enjoy such rights, there is no requirement for the government to accommodate the applicants by permitting someone entrance to Canada to meet with and speak to them.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: Because of this, and because there is no other record of the reasons for making the decision, the notes of the subordinate reviewing officer should be taken, by inference, to be the reasons for decision. Accepting documents such as these notes as sufficient reasons is part of the flexibility that is necessary, as emphasized by Macdonald and Lametti, supra, when courts evaluate the requirements of the duty of fairness with recognition of the day-to-day realities of administrative agencies and the many ways in which the values underlying the principles of procedural fairness can be assured. It upholds the principle that individuals are entitled to fair procedures and open decision-making, but recognizes that in the administrative context, this transparency may take place in various ways. I conclude that the notes of Officer Lorenz satisfy the requirement for reasons under the duty of procedural fairness in this case, and they will be taken to be the reasons for decision. < TARGETCASE>","The notes of a subordinate reviewing officer can be taken as the reasons for decision, upholding the principle of fair procedures and open decision-making in the administrative context."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [29] As quoted above, with respect to the Applicant's action or inaction in seeking state protection in Brazil, the RPD made the following finding: <REFERENCE> ""I find that her efforts to avail herself of state protection falls far short of a diligent attempt prior to seeking asylum abroad and does not rebut the presumption that the state can protect its citizens ( <REFERENCE> ). <REFERENCE> Thus, Kadenko is applied by the RPD to create the expectation that the Applicant in the present case should have approached ""higher authorities"" or investigated the failure to prosecute the predator in order to establish that she attempted to access state protection. In my opinion, having regard to the decision <REFERENCE> , as advanced in the Gender Guidelines , the expectations are capricious because they are not based on a contextualized understanding of the Applicant's real life situation in Brazil; that is, there is no evidence that, for her, the expectations are realistic.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [31] The Applicant argues that when all of this information is considered, it is clear that HRSDC is mandated to assess the genuineness of the offer of employment when determining whether or not to approve an AEO. HRSDC has specialized knowledge of the Canadian labour market, and a visa officer is not well placed to substitute her judgment for that of HRSDC, a body with specific expertise. The Applicant argues that the present situation is analogous to the establishment of the National Occupation Classification (NOC) matrix. The NOC has been found by this Court to be a ""binding direction"" to visa officers as to the assessment of applicants for a visa, and an officer may not add to the requirements of an NOC based on his own view of the labour market (see <TARGETCASE> at paras 4 and 5).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [16] That leads me to the PRRA officer’s analysis of Article 310. Counsel for the children claims the officer erred by employing the notion of a “law of general application”, because that concept is only meant to deal with the question of nexus when assessing Convention refugee claims under section 96 of the IRPA. The lead case on this issue is <TARGETCASE> (F.C.A.). Because the issue of nexus is irrelevant under section 97, counsel argues, the officer erred. Instead, the officer should have analyzed Article 310 according to the language in paragraph 97(1)(b)(iii) of the IRPA, which says: 97.(1) A person in need of protection is a person in Canada whose removal to their country or countries of nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence would subject them personally (b) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if (iii) the risk is not inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions, unless imposed in disregard of accepted international standards… ","The concept of a 'law of general application' should not be used when assessing claims under section 97 of the IRPA, as the issue of nexus is irrelevant in this context."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [100] The respondents make an alternative argument in support of their claims for mandamus and assert that the remedy should be granted under the doctrine of legitimate expectations. While there is some support in the case law for the notion that an administrative actor may be required to follow a procedure it has promised to follow (see e.g. TARGETCASE), the party seeking to enforce the promise must show it to have been clearly made. In the words of Justice Binnie in REFERENCE: ...Generally speaking, government representations will be considered sufficiently precise for purposes of the doctrine of legitimate expectations if, had they been made in the context of a private law contract, they would be sufficiently certain to be capable of enforcement.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [28] I note that the third and fourth questions are similar to those certified <TARGETCASE> , in which the appeal was abandoned.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [24] I have earlier commented on the immigration objective reflected in paragraph 3(c) of the Act . I noted the relatively narrow wording of that paragraph. As indicated in footnote 6 to these reasons, Madame Justice L'Heureux-Dubé commented on that immigration objective. She wrote: <REFERENCE> ""Although this provision [paragraph 3(c)] speaks of Parliament's objective of reuniting citizens and permanent residents with their close relatives from abroad, it is consistent, in my opinion, with a large and liberal interpretation of the values underlying this legislation and its purposes to presume that Parliament also placed a high value on keeping citizens and permanent residents together with their close relatives who are already in Canada. The obligation to take seriously and place important weight on keeping children in contact with both parents, if possible, and maintaining connections between close family members is suggested by the objective articulated in s. 3(c). <TARGETCASE> ","The obligation to take seriously and place important weight on keeping children in contact with both parents, if possible, and maintaining connections between close family members is suggested by the objective articulated in s. 3(c)."

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [44] The Plaintiffs refer to jurisprudence where injunctions have been issued in situations where the sales of a patented product represented a significant proportion of the plaintiff’s total sales. <REFERENCE> (Qc. Sup. Ct.), the patented product accounted for 80% of plaintiff’s sales. <REFERENCE> (F.C.T.D.), 30% of sales were attributable to the patented product. Finally, in <REFERENCE> (F.C.T.D.), the defendant was enjoined in a situation where a “significant” market share was held by the plaintiff’s patented product. Given the Plaintiffs’ dependence on COVERSYL, the Plaintiffs submit that loss of this market will be permanent. In turn, the Plaintiffs refer to jurisprudence that establishes that injunctions should be granted where the plaintiff is able to demonstrate that it will suffer permanent market loss (see, for example, <TARGETCASE> (F.C.T.D.), varied as to costs (1989), 26 C.P.R.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [21] It is clear that Mr. Justice Sopinka, writing for the majority of the Supreme Court, was of the view that ""functus officio"", a principle developed with a view to creating a workable division of jurisdiction between trial courts and courts of appeal, should not be as rigidly applied in the context of administrative tribunals, where there is evidence of legislative intent against a strict approach. According to Mr. Justice Sopinka, the doctrine (at page 142): <TARGETCASE> ""... is based, however, on the policy ground which favours finality of proceedings rather than the rule which was developed with respect to formal judgments of a court whose decision was subject to a full appeal. For this reason, I am of the opinion that its application must be more flexible and less formalistic in respect to the decisions of administrative tribunals which are subject to appeal only on a point of law. Justice may require the reopening of administrative proceedings in order to provide relief which would otherwise be available on appeal. <REFERENCE> "" Accordingly, the principle should not be strictly applied where there are indications in the enabling statute that a decision can be reopened in order to enable the tribunal to discharge the function committed to it by enabling legislation .

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [29] The Applicant submits that the Board erred in the sur place aspect of his claim by selectively analyzing the evidence. While it is entitled to provide greater weight to some evidence, it must provide reasons for preferring that evidence to crucial, contradictory evidence ( <REFERENCE> (QL)(CA) [ Cepeda-Gutierrez ]; <REFERENCE> ).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [43] An enforcement officer's power to defer removal arises under subsection 48(2) of the Act. As acknowledged by both parties, an enforcement officer has limited discretion to defer a removal until it is reasonably practicable (see TARGETCASE). Generally, deferral is limited to cases where there is a serious, practical impediment to the removal (see REFERENCE).

Linden, J.A., also stated at p. 175 that the reference decision ""... is merely one stage of a proceeding which may or may not result in a final revocation of citizenship and deportation or extradition.""

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [47] The Access to Information Act serves to facilitate the right of access to information by requesters ( National Defence at paragraph 15). It is fundamental to Canada's democratic process ( <TARGETCASE> at paragraph 61). The Act recognizes that the information in the hands of government should be available to the public, but this right to access is subject to necessary exemptions ( National Defence , at paragraphs 15 and 16). Section 23's solicitor-client privilege is a discretionary, class exemption. The exemption in section 23 ensures that the government has the same protection for its legal documents as persons in the private sector. It permits the head of a government institution to refuse to disclose records containing information subject to solicitor-client privilege. The burden of proving that an exemption applies rests on the party opposing disclosure ( Toronto Sun at paragraph 9), which in this case is the respondent, Health Canada.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [45] In <TARGETCASE> , supra, the patent at issue disclosed a mechanical device, an ""inhaler"", for the administration of medicine, comprised of several metal components. The applicants in that case argued that the fact that the inhaler was not ingested into the body was immaterial, and that as long as its function was to deliver the active ingredient to the patient, it fell within the ratio of <REFERENCE> , supra, as being a medicine. Justice Tremblay-Lamer did not accept this argument and held that such interpretation of <REFERENCE> , supra, was incorrect because <REFERENCE> explicitly dealt with compositions of active and inactive ingredients which were physically mixed together and ingested into the body as a single composition and was not intended to apply to a mechanical device as an inactive ingredient. The Federal Court of Appeal affirmed this issue, while reversing on other grounds, and stated at page 527 [C.P.R.]: ""With respect to the substantive issue raised by <REFERENCE> in its cross-appeal, we share the view of the trial judge that the patents at issue, being patents for devices by which medicaments can be administered to or by patients rather than patents for the substance being administered, are not a 'medicine' within the meaning of the Regulations .""

Accordingly, he wrote the following at pp. 589 to 591: ""From the outset, it is important to set forth certain principles of judicial review. There exist various standards of review with respect to the myriad of administrative agencies that exist in our country. The central question in ascertaining the standard of review is to determine the legislative intent in conferring jurisdiction on the administrative tribunal. In answering this question, the courts have looked at various factors. Included in the analysis is an examination of the tribunal's role or function. Also crucial is whether or not the agency's decisions are protected by a privative clause. Finally, of fundamental importance is whether or not the question goes to the jurisdiction of the tribunal involved.","The central question in ascertaining the standard of review is to determine the legislative intent in conferring jurisdiction on the administrative tribunal, considering factors such as the tribunal's role or function, whether the agency's decisions are protected by a privative clause, and whether the question goes to the jurisdiction of the tribunal involved."

Indeed, in a letter from the principal applicant's sister-in-law that the PRRA officer accepted as true, she told the principal applicant that her own son had gone into hiding, so there was evidence that the situation was bad enough that the principal applicant might do the same.

The conditions at the time the applicants fled their country are relevant, but only to the extent that other evidence fails to show it is no longer reasonable for them to fear persecution due to the changes.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [9] As set out in <REFERENCE> , above, the Court has the discretion to decide the matter even if it is moot. In <TARGETCASE> , above, the Supreme Court of Canada set out three issues to consider when determining if the Court should exercise this discretion.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: With respect to her relationship, the claimant attempted to nuance its importance. These inconsistencies in the claimant’s evidence cast serious doubt on the believability of her allegations. It is not clear from this passage what the Board required in the way of a credible explanation. Ms. Otti had given detailed explanations for all of the Board’s concerns. While it was open to the Board to make the findings it did about her dependant child, it was also incumbent upon the Board to explain why Ms. Otti’s explanations were found lacking. It is not enough for the Board to express a bare credibility conclusion or to rely upon vague concerns or non-sequiturs. It has an obligation to rationally explain why a claimant’s evidence is considered unreliable. By failing to provide valid reasons for its finding that Ms. Otti lacked credibility, the Board’s decision is patently unreasonable: see <TARGETCASE> ; 2005 FC 1619.",The Board has an obligation to rationally explain why a claimant’s evidence is considered unreliable and failing to provide valid reasons for its finding that a claimant lacked credibility makes the decision patently unreasonable.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [46] I need go no further to decide the case before me. As cases arise, the court will be called upon to decide if, on the facts before the judge at that time, deferral is justified in the name of other legal obligations which bind the Minister. An issue to be considered will be whether such obligations are commensurate with the obligation to execute removal orders ""as soon as reasonably practicable"". For example, these reasons do not address the effect of the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in <TARGETCASE> , because it does not arise on these facts. Furthermore, it is well known that bad faith and arbitrariness are always within the remedial jurisdiction of a court exercising its supervisory jurisdiction over administrative action.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [23] The requirements of procedural fairness in the context of a passport revocation and permanent passport services suspension were considered in <REFERENCE> [ Kamel ] (which was overturned by the Federal Court of Appeal in <TARGETCASE> but not on these points). The situation in Kamel was different from that in the present case in that here the passport services were suspended by Passport Canada for five years. In Kamel , on the other hand, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Trade suspended Mr. Kamel's passport services indefinitely, based on the determination that he posed a security risk. The Minister's decision turned on a report from the Canadian Security Intelligence Service that was not disclosed to Mr. Kamel. Justice Noël determined that, in not being informed of the substance of the report, Mr. Kamel had been denied procedural fairness which, in the circumstances of that case, required that Mr. Kamal be provided with the ability to engage in ""full participation"" in the process before the Minister.","In the context of a passport revocation and permanent passport services suspension, procedural fairness requires that the individual be provided with the ability to engage in 'full participation' in the process."

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [186] Accordingly, as of March 16, 1985, I find that the patent satisfied, subject to obviousness, the requirements of s. 2 of the Act and does not exceed the invention claimed. The idea, hypothesis or theory had, at this time, been reduced to a definite and practical shape: <TARGETCASE> invalid because it does not disclose the true inventors. This submission has two parts. Firstly, if the named inventors are correct, the patent is invalid because Glaxo failed to name Dr. Broder and Dr. Mitsuya as co-inventors in the patent.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [34] The Federal Court of Appeal recognized the test for an IFA in <REFERENCE> , as laid out in <TARGETCASE> : An IFA cannot be speculative or theoretical only; it must be a realistic, attainable option. Essentially, this means that the alternative place of safety must be realistically accessible to the claimant. Any barriers to getting there should be reasonably surmountable. The claimant cannot be required to encounter great physical danger or to undergo undue hardship in travelling there or in staying there. For example, claimants should not be required to cross battle lines where fighting is going on at great risk to their lives in order to reach a place of safety. Similarly, claimants should not be compelled to hide out in an isolated region of their country, like a cave in the mountains, or in a desert or a jungle, if those are the only areas of internal safety available.","An Internal Flight Alternative (IFA) must be a realistic, attainable option, not speculative or theoretical, and should not require the claimant to encounter great physical danger or undergo undue hardship in reaching or staying there."

","The assessment of state protection is largely a factual assessment made on a case by case basis, and it is presumed that the Refugee Protection Division weighed all of the evidence."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [11] It is well established that the standard of review that applies to the Board's factual findings should be that of patent unreasonableness.

","A patently unreasonable decision is one that is 'clearly irrational' or 'evidently not in accordance with reason', so flawed that no amount of curial deference can justify letting it stand."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [24] I would additionally note that I find the Board to have employed an inappropriate understanding of demeanour in its analysis. The RPD buttressed its negative credibility determination by noting that during the hearing the applicant sat with his arms crossed and appeared ""sullen and arrogant"" which was ""not an attitude one would reasonably expect from someone asking a foreign country to save his life"" (Decision at para 35). While this Court has recognized that the Board is well-positioned to assess a claimant's demeanour in its credibility determinations, demeanour is intended to encompass the way in which the claimant responds to questions, such as whether the claimant appears uncertain or hesitates. For instance, in TARGETCASE, Justice Harrington wrote, REFERENCE. In contrast, overly subjective conclusions based on an individual's posture or perceived attitude are not within the appropriate purview of a credibility assessment.

No doubt, that decision of the ultimate Court of Canada would today have been decided differently in light of its own decisions in: <TARGETCASE> ; and <REFERENCE> Q.A.C. 1, at p. 794, among others. These last cited judgments strongly indicate that today the Supreme Court would be most hesitant about going counter to concurrent findings.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [17] In my view, the remaining two questions raised on this application are questions relating to the admissibility of evidence. The admission of documents that ought not to have been admitted constitutes a breach of procedural fairness.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [31] Based on the rationale in Canada (Minister of Citizenship and <TARGETCASE> ; 151 F.T.R. 101 (T.D.) and, in particular, on the availability of an exemption from the operation of paragraph 34(1)(f) in appropriate cases, the Federal Court of Appeal repeats in <REFERENCE> at paragraphs 29-32 that the term ""member"" under the Act should continue to be interpreted broadly: ""Nonetheless, Mr. Poshteh says that the Immigration Division erred by determining the question of membership on the basis of the nature and duration of his activities, while failing to consider his level of integration within the organization. He says the key consideration for membership is a significant level of integration within an organization. He submits that adopting significant integration as the test for membership would promote more consistent decision- making by the Immigration Division. ""I am not persuaded that Mr. Poshteh's significant integration test would achieve the consistency that he says is presently lacking in Immigration Division decisions. A significant integration test would still require an assessment of the facts and a judgment as to whether the degree of integration in any particular case was sufficient to constitute the individual a member. More importantly, a test for membership based on significant integration would not be consistent with the broad interpretation to be given to the term 'member.'

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [13] It is important to remember that the substance of the duty of fairness is flexible and variable and depends, inter alia, on a given set of circumstances in the case. The Supreme Court of Canada laid out criteria to guide the courts in this matter in <TARGETCASE> ; 205 N.R. 383 (F.C.A.), the Court had to examine the substance of that duty in the context of a decision by the Commission to dismiss a complaint after investigation, specifically with reference to the thoroughness of the investigation.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [39] In the present case, even leaving aside the decade in which Mr. Beltran was unable to apply for permanent resident status because of his criminal conviction, the delay is inexcusable. The record reveals very little information available with respect to LP-28, and its alleged relationship with FMLN. Although some of the literature disclosed by the Minister and to be produced at the admissibility hearing post-dates the 1980-1991 civil war in El Salvador, it does not appear that any new information has come to light. There is nothing in the record to indicate that CSIS was wrong in its 1989 analysis.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [11] With respect to the Applicant's assertion that the Visa Officer erred in not awarding four points for Adaptability based on her husband's education, this would be a decision whose standard of review would be reasonability, involving as it does a mixed question of law and fact. I am not satisfied on the evidence that the Officer made an unreasonable decision in this respect. There is some conflict in the evidence as to whether the Officer squarely raised her concern with the Applicant and her husband as to the husband's University education and the Applicant's affidavit is not sufficiently detailed to support her position. While the Visa Officer's concerns about the husband's degree may seem open to question, I am unable to say on the record before me that they were unreasonable. <REFERENCE> Disposition <TARGETCASE> ","The standard of review for a decision on awarding points for Adaptability based on a spouse's education in a visa application is reasonability, as it involves a mixed question of law and fact."

The Applicants do not challenge the credibility finding, but submit that the RPD applied the wrong legal test for refugee protection ( <REFERENCE> (CA) (QL) [ <TARGETCASE> ]). The Applicants submit that the RPD did not refer to any of the country conditions documentary evidence of pervasive and serious systemic discrimination against Roma in Hungary, who are similarly situated persons. Instead, it wrongly focused on whether the Applicants had established that they had been persecuted in the past, rather than conducting a prospective analysis ( <REFERENCE> [ Fi ]; <REFERENCE> [ <REFERENCE> ]).

In my opinion, having regard to the decision <REFERENCE> , as advanced in the Gender Guidelines , the expectations are capricious because they are not based on a contextualized understanding of the Applicant's real life situation in Brazil; that is, there is no evidence that, for her, the expectations are realistic.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [42] They also say that the fact that the remedy of mandamus was not originally pleaded is not a bar on judicial review. The Court can and does craft its own remedies to meet the errors identified in a judicial review application. In addition, the TRP application was refused on the grounds that no decision would be made. This is, in effect, a refusal to carry out a clear statutory duty: TARGETCASE.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [9] This Court has also held that determining whether the residency requirement has been met consists of a two stage inquiry.

If, and only if this requirement has been met does one proceed to the second stage of the inquiry which contemplates whether the applicant has accumulated 1,095 days (the equivalent of three years) of residency in <TARGETCASE> . Failure to find that there is a residence in Canada ends the matter: <REFERENCE> was one of the first cases of this Court to address subsection 5(c)(1) [subsection 5(b) as it then was] of the Act . In that case, the applicant had immigrated to Canada from Crete. He attended university in Nova Scotia and established residency with some friends. However, Papadogiorgakis shortly thereafter went to university in the United States, occasionally making trips back to Canada. He divided his place of physical presence between the two countries.

While he did not say so expressly, he seems to have accepted the defendant's argument, strongly urged before us, that the plaintiff's only entitlement was to profits arising directly out of the sale of infringing press sections. In our view, he erred in doing so. We can see no reason in principle why a patentee, whose property has been wrongly appropriated through infringement, should not recover all the profits, direct and indirect, derived by the infringer from his wrongful infringement ... ' Questions as to whether any proportion of the profits earned by the defendant on the sales of noninfringing parts of paper machines was due to such machines having infringing press sections incorporated into them and the amount thereof, if any, are difficult questions of fact .'""

F-7, as amended. This goes well beyond this Court assuring itself that the interpretation chosen by the Citizenship Officer accords with any applicable citizenship legislation (or regulation or Order in Council) : see paragraph 18.1(4)(b) of the Federal Courts Act . In this regard, the Constitution of Canada is the supreme law of Canada, and any law, regulation, administrative decision or order authorized by statute that is inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution is, to the extent of the inconsistency, of no force or effect (subsection 52(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982 , being Schedule B to the Canada Act 1982 (U.K.), 1982, c. 11) unless, in cases where a right guaranteed by the Charter is infringed or denied, such an infringement or denial can be justified under section 1 of the Charter : see <TARGETCASE> . The Bill of Rights is a quasi-constitutional statute: unless the conflicting legislation expressly declares that it operates notwithstanding the Bill (as required by section 2) where federal legislation conflicts with its protections, the latter applies and the legislation (or part thereof) is inoperative: see <REFERENCE> at para. 28; <REFERENCE> O.A.C. 363 at para. 32.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: I cannot accept this argument in the case at bar. The reasoning advanced by the Defendants to the Counterclaim would hold true if the disclaimed claims in their original form were indeed too broad. However, quite to the contrary, it is the disclaimer that would impermissibly broaden the scope of the claim. I appreciate that Richards, by filing the disclaimer, conceded that their original patent was too broad in scope. There is, however, no independent evidence to that effect, and the Defendants to the Counterclaim have not submitted any arguments in support of their claim that the original patent is overbroad. Contrary to the hypothetical example given by Justice Martineau in <TARGETCASE> , at para 49, where he assumes that a line can clearly be drawn between the scope of the original claim and the more limited scope of the disclaimed claim, there is no such clear line in the present case.",A line cannot always be clearly drawn between the scope of the original claim and the more limited scope of the disclaimed claim.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [28] The doctor's conclusions were not contradicted by any other expertise and they certainly deserve to be dealt with more thoroughly. I find this case to be on all fours with another case decided by my colleague Justice Mactavish, in which the Officer similarly said very little about a psychologist report. I adopt and make mine what my colleague had to say in this respect: The uncontradicted expert evidence before the PRRA Officer was that Ms. Davis would be at risk of a complete emotional breakdown if she were forced to return to St. Vincent, which could well result in her becoming suicidal. In such circumstances, it was not enough for the Officer to simply look at the availability of mental health care in St. Vincent. As Ms. Davis' counsel put it, even if the health care in St. Vincent was perfect, the Officer still had to determine whether putting Ms. Davis through all of this amounted to undue, undeserved or disproportionate hardship. This question was never really addressed by the Officer, further rendering the decision unreasonable. <REFERENCE> . See also: <TARGETCASE> .

However, the applicant argues that there is a difference between no right to an appeal and appeal only with concurrence of the very judge whose judgment in the subject of the desired appeal. This, the applicant claims, creates a reasonable apprehension of bias.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [14] In contrast to REFERENCE, by Mr. Justice Muldoon. At issue there was the breach of four consecutive court orders as to production of documents in a very substantial claim: REFERENCE REFERENCE, REFERENCEur specific Court Orders. The action is thus dismissed by reason of abuse of process."" (Unreported 15 December 1999 reasons) In TARGETCASE the plaintiffs' statement of claim was struck out.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [4] The above recited issues are truly what are in serious contention in these proceedings. However, the respondent Duncan, among the ""points to be argued"", in her filed application record, raises the matter of the applicant's alleged estoppel ""from arguing before this Honourable Court that the adjudicator lacked jurisdiction due to the appellant [sic], as a party to the litigation, consenting to the adjudicator's jurisdiction at first instance"". Indeed in part II of his written decision, titled Jurisdiction, the adjudicator stated that the parties, by counsel, had agreed that ""Ms. Duncan's employment was in, or in connection with the operation of a federal work: s. 167(1) Code "" among other points tracking specific statutory provisions. The applicant contends that it is not estopped. <TARGETCASE> ",The applicant is not estopped from arguing that the adjudicator lacked jurisdiction despite initially consenting to the adjudicator's jurisdiction.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [43] First, as in the case of a PRRA, the Court finds that the standard of review to be applied to the RAD's decision with respect to the admissibility of fresh evidence is that of reasonableness. As Justice de Montigny noted in <TARGETCASE> ACWS (3d) 426, applying a provision to the particular facts of a case is a question of mixed fact and law, to be reviewed on a standard of reasonableness (at para 20). ","Applying a provision to the particular facts of a case is a question of mixed fact and law, to be reviewed on a standard of reasonableness."

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [189] The attitude betrayed by the decision-maker's acts and omissions in this case is not analogous to the work of the Governor in Council's delegates in Wedge and <REFERENCE> , above. In Wedge , Ms. Bloodworth made the initiative to contact the affected party to alert him to the reasons for dissatisfaction. The reports were sent diligently. In <TARGETCASE> , it seems that the conduct of Ms. Jauvin and the Privy Council Office personnel was exemplary, based on the Sharlow, J.,'s description of it. Mr. Weatherill was even offered the opportunity to meet with the representatives of the Auditor General, the agency that prepared the report about him. The exchanges between Ms. Jauvin and Mr. Weatherill's counsel, Mr. Hefferson, were prompt. Ms. Jauvin responded diligently to his letters. Additional time was given when requested. Mr. Weatherill had even been advised that the process would follow its course after his motion for an interim injunction was dismissed. It does not appear to me that this kind of diligent, professional conduct was observed in regard to Mr. Vennat. ","Exemplary conduct by decision-makers includes diligent, professional actions such as prompt responses, offering opportunities for meetings, and providing additional time when requested."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [188] In REFERENCE , the Federal Court of Appeal did adopt a flexible approach to the interpretation of ""criminal organization"", which is not defined in the IRPA: 37 Paragraph 37(1)(a) appears to be an attempt to tackle organized crime, in recognition of the fact that non-citizen members of criminal organizations are as grave a threat as individuals who are convicted of serious criminal offences. It enables deportation of members of criminal organizations who avoid convictions as individuals but may nevertheless be dangerous. 38 Recent jurisprudence supports this interpretation. In TARGETCASE, reversed on other grounds, ","Criminal organization"" interpretation should be flexible, allowing for deportation of members who avoid individual convictions but may still be dangerous."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [29] I must recall that while the construction of a patent is for the court, the specification (including both disclosure and claims) is directed to a person skilled in the art at the date of the patent and the knowledge such a person is expected to possess is to be taken into consideration (see <TARGETCASE> , at 101 and 104, and Fox, Canadian Patent Law (4th) p. 206). The claims are read as part of the entire patent and not as a separate document. <REFERENCE> C.P.R.(2d) 1, the Federal Court of Appeal recognized that resort may be had to the disclosure to assist in interpreting the claims. Indeed, after having reviewed the relevant authorities and the principles applicable in the construction of patents, Mr. Justice Urie, at page 11, summarized those principles as follows: ""In summary, the principles which I derive from the above-mentioned authorities as well as from others referred to in argument, to which further reference need not be made here, are that in construing the claims in a patent recourse to the remainder of the specification is (a) permissible only to assist in understanding terms used in the claims; (b) unnecessary where the words of the claim are plain and unambiguous; and (c) improper to vary the scope or ambit of the claims. There may well be other principles applicable in the construction of claims but the foregoing are those to be borne in mind in dealing with the attacks on the trial judgment in this appeal."" ","The construction of a patent is for the court, but the specification is directed to a person skilled in the art at the date of the patent and their expected knowledge is to be considered."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [12] The standard of review for the issue of state protection is that of reasonableness simpliciter as it is a mixed question of fact and law which involves applying the legal standard of ""clear and convincing confirmation of a state's inability to protect"" ( <REFERENCE> ), to a set of facts ( <TARGETCASE> ; 2005 FC 193, at paragraphs 9-12). <REFERENCE> Credibility and plausibility of the testimony <REFERENCE> ","The standard of review for the issue of state protection is reasonableness simpliciter, involving the application of the legal standard of ""clear and convincing confirmation of a state's inability to protect"" to a set of facts."
question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [23] It is well established that there is no infringement of a patent in selling an article which does not in itself infringe the patent even when the vendor knows that the purchaser buys the article for the purpose of using it in the infringement of the patent: TARGETCASE. ,"Selling an article which does not in itself infringe the patent is not an infringement of the patent, even when the vendor knows that the purchaser intends to use it for infringing the patent."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [50] It can be equally unhelpful to look for guidance from authorities where legal fees have been approved as a percentage of the amounts recovered. A reasonable fee should bear an appropriate relationship to the amount recovered: see <REFERENCE> , above, at para 80. Cases that generate a recovery of a few million dollars may well justify a 25% to 30% costs award. It is more difficult to support such an approach where the award is in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Presumably that is the reason why class counsel are not relying on the initial contingency fee allowance of 30%. That is also the reason that the three authorities that represent the strongest comparators to this case in terms of amounts recovered fall at the bottom of the scale of costs awarded in percentage terms: see <REFERENCE> 83 OR (3d) 481; <TARGETCASE> , above, and <REFERENCE> , above. [see footnote 2] These comparable decisions do not support an award of costs in this case of approximately 7.5% or, in financial terms, $65 million. Conclusion ",The three authorities that represent the strongest comparators to this case in terms of amounts recovered fall at the bottom of the scale of costs awarded in percentage terms.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [12] After noting the issues raised by the applicant in the appeal, the RAD stated that it focused on four issues: <REFERENCE> Did the RPD err in its finding of fact that the applicant's allegations of fear of gangs were credible? <REFERENCE> Did the RPD err in its finding of fact that the applicant did not want to complete military service? <REFERENCE> Did the RPD err in its finding of fact that the applicant was a supporter of the opposition and that he demonstrated a nexus to the Convention because of his imputed political opinion? <TARGETCASE> Did the RPD err in its finding of fact that the applicant's delay in claiming undermined his subjective fear, which was fatal to his claim? <REFERENCE> ","An applicant's delay in claiming can undermine his subjective fear, which can be fatal to his claim."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [67] In Consolidated- <TARGETCASE> , and Ellis-Don , supra, panel members of the Labour Relations Board (""Board"") who heard the cases participated in full Board meetings where the law and policy affecting their decisions was discussed extensively. The Supreme Court condoned these practices because they were legitimate consultations that were held in the interests of ensuring consistency in the Boards' jurisprudence and because no facts particular to the cases before the panels were debated. The decision-makers were the panel members who heard the case and no new facts arose to which the parties did not have a chance to respond. Thus, the two principles of natural justice, the right to respond to the case against you and the right to be heard by an unbiased decision-maker were not breached. ","The right to respond to the case against you and the right to be heard by an unbiased decision-maker are not breached when panel members who heard the cases participate in full Board meetings discussing law and policy, as long as no new facts arise to which the parties did not have a chance to respond."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [10] As to bad faith by CPAA, CPC says the CPAA agreed to the arbitration alternative, obtained consideration for withdrawing the 1982 complaint, filed the same complaint in 1992/1993 and, according to CPC, deceived CPC by entering into the 1985 agreement while knowing that the Commission would continue its investigation. With respect to bad faith, the staff reasons state at p. 6: <REFERENCE> ""The settlement to which the respondent (CPC) refers came about and was renewed in a labour relations context, was never approved by the Commission or, after nine years of negotiations, fully implemented. In fact, it proved to be an unsuccessful attempt to resolve a human rights issue through labour relations. That the complainant now seek to avail itself of the complaint process as a means of resolving what it perceives as a current discriminatory situation is not an indication of bad faith. <REFERENCE> On this issue there is a question of the Commission failing to take account of relevant considerations because, on the basis of the material before me, CPAA's conduct has been, at least, dubious: <TARGETCASE> (1)","There is a question of the Commission failing to take account of relevant considerations because CPAA's conduct has been, at least, dubious."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [34] Apotex argues that it does not have to prove on a balance of probabilities that, but for the operation of the Regulations , it would have entered the norfloxacin market. Rather, it need only show that it had a reasonable chance of doing so. The cases relied on by Apotex for this proposition deal with the calculation of damages where courts must consider the likelihood of future contingencies that might affect quantum (e.g., <REFERENCE> B.C.A.C. 243; 132 W.A.C. 243; <REFERENCE> ). But here we are considering Merck's liability for damages, not the quantification of those damages. At this stage, in my view, Apotex must show on a balance of probabilities that it was prevented from getting into the norfloxacin market because of Merck's prohibition application. As Justice Norris said in <REFERENCE> , Apotex must ""establish on the balance of probabilities that the chance of making a profit was real and not fanciful"" (para. 5(e)). This is consistent with the approach taken by Justice Johanne Gauthier in <TARGETCASE> at para. 762. In the circumstances, Apotex must show, at a minimum, that it had access to a supply of norfloxacin. Without that, its assertion that it was kept out of the market by Merck's prohibition application would be fanciful, not real. ",Apotex must establish on the balance of probabilities that the chance of making a profit was real and not fanciful.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [8] The plaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating that the Prothonotary's order is clearly wrong, in the sense that the exercise of discretion by the Prothonotary was based upon a wrong principle or upon a misapprehension of the facts ( <TARGETCASE> ","The plaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating that the Prothonotary's order is clearly wrong, in the sense that the exercise of discretion by the Prothonotary was based upon a wrong principle or upon a misapprehension of the facts."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [23] Justice Near (as he was then) of the Federal Court in <TARGETCASE> in dealing with a remigrant situation found that citizenship, if lost, could be reobtained, thus precluding a refugee claim. He wrote at paragraphs 34 and 35: 34. In my opinion, this case is distinguishable on the facts. In Khan, above, the Board discussed whether the Applicant could obtain Guyanese citizenship after marrying a Guyanese citizen. She had never independently obtained Guyanese citizenship in the past. In the present case, the Applicant is a Guyanese citizen by birth and has never officially renounced her citizenship. Even if she is not a Guyanese citizen anymore because of her dual citizenship, she could obtain remigrant status. As such, unlike in Khan, above, the Board did not provide its opinion on whether the Guyanese authorities would exercise their discretion to refuse citizenship to the Applicant. 35. The decision in <REFERENCE> , should be followed. Since it is ""within the control of the [A]pplicant to acquire the citizenship of a country with respect to which [she] has no well-founded fear of persecution,"" the Applicant should seek protection in her other country of nationality, Guyana, before seeking protection in Canada. Consequently, the Board did not err in its conclusion. ","Citizenship, if lost, could be reobtained, thus precluding a refugee claim."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [26] It has been affirmed repeatedly that state protection is not required to be perfect, only adequate, but that such adequacy is to be assessed at the operational level (see <REFERENCE> ). In other words, immigration officers are required to take a bottom line approach and assess evidence of state protection not on the intentions and initiatives of the state, but on its implementation and effectiveness. <TARGETCASE> ","State protection is not required to be perfect, only adequate, and such adequacy is to be assessed at the operational level, focusing on the state's implementation and effectiveness, not its intentions and initiatives."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [19] Taken together, I am of the view that the pragmatic and functional approach indicate the appropriate standard of review is the standard of reasonableness: see also TARGETCASE.

",The officer's decision shall not be disturbed unless it is not supported by any reasons that can stand up to a somewhat probing examination.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: The principle of judicial comity has been expressed as follows : The generally accepted view is that this court is bound to follow a previous decision of the court unless it can be shown that the previous decision was manifestly wrong, or should no longer be followed: for example, (1) the decision failed to consider legislation or binding authorities which would have produced a different result, or (2) the decision, if followed, would result in a severe injustice. The reason generally assigned for this approach is a judicial comity. While doubtless this is a fundamental reason for the approach, I think that an equally fundamental, if not more compelling, reason is the need for certainty in the law, so far as that can be established. Lawyers would be in an intolerable position in advising clients if a division of the court was free to decide an appeal without regard to a previous decision or the principle involved in it. ( <TARGETCASE> D.T.C. 5205 : I think I am bound to approach the matter in the same way as the similar problem was approached in each of these cases until such time, if any, as a different course is indicated by a higher Court.","A court is bound to follow a previous decision unless it was manifestly wrong or should no longer be followed due to reasons such as failure to consider legislation or binding authorities, or if following the decision would result in severe injustice."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [21] It is not uncommon for one Immigration Officer to determine an immigrant's PRRA and H&C application. As was done here, the assessment of one follows on the heels of the other. Ideally, the officer's familiarity with the file leads to better decisions. However, this Court has expressed concern on occasion from some adverse consequences of this practice. <TARGETCASE> ","An Immigration Officer determining both an immigrant's PRRA and H&C application can lead to better decisions due to familiarity with the file, but there can be adverse consequences."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [18] It is true that there is no antinomy between the common law and civil law criteria and that a court would not err in taking into consideration common law criteria ( REFERENCE). However, in the case at bar, the Pension Centre did not merely take the common law criteria into consideration: it applied them without considering the provisions of the CCQ. Even if there is some overlap between civil law and common law criteria, they are not interchangeable. In TARGETCASE, which also concerned the characterization of a contract, the Federal Court of Appeal held as follows: REFERENCE ","Civil law and common law criteria, even if overlapping, are not interchangeable in the characterization of a contract."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [32] Moreover, under s. 7 of the Canadian Regulations the Patent Act and Regulations made under it are to apply in respect of an international application when the applicant has complied with ss. 13 and 14 of the Regulations . Section 14 is not applicable in the circumstances of this case for it deals with a situation where Canada is elected by an applicant in an international application. Section 13 sets out requirements, for entry into the national phase, of ""an applicant who designates Canada in an international application"". Since the international application in this case did not designate Canada the requirements for entry into the national phase of the application cannot be met. Thus, the requirements set by s. 7 for the application of the Patent Act and Regulations made under it, including the Patent Cooperation Treaty Regulations themselves, are not met. The Act and Regulations do not apply to the Celltech application as submitted to the Patent Office. <TARGETCASE> ","The Patent Act and Regulations, including the Patent Cooperation Treaty Regulations, do not apply to an international application that does not designate Canada for entry into the national phase."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [31] The matter is further elucidated in an annotation to the Cameron Packaging case, written by one Gordon E. Wood, beginning on p. 156: <REFERENCE> ANNOTATION <REFERENCE> ""Cromarty, J., finds that an application pursuant to rule 126 is not an interlocutory application on the basis that it can result in an order finally disposing of the rights of the parties. On the face of it, the reference in rule 292 to interlocutory motions clearly appears to advert to the distinction between interlocutory and originating motions, and not to the distinction between interlocutory and final orders. As is stated in Williston and Rolls, The Law of Civil Procedure (1970), vol. 1, at p. 470: <REFERENCE> 'The distinction between originating and interlocutory motions should not be confused with the distinction between final and interlocutory orders. An originating motion may in some cases give rise to an interlocutory order; conversely, an interlocutory application may in certain cases give rise to a final order.' <REFERENCE> ""Cromarty, J., refers to <REFERENCE> that case, Stark, J., stated (at p. 141): <REFERENCE> 'My view is that while in form it commenced as an interlocutory matter, in the result it soon became evident that it was or could be a final disposition.' <TARGETCASE> ""Stark, J., then went on to refer to the reasons of Fraser, J., in Re H.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [30] <TARGETCASE> ( Esmaeili-Tarki ), my colleague, Justice Michel Beaudry found that a mandamus order should issue against the MPS. The applicant applied for ministerial relief in 1999 and was denied that relief in 2004. That decision, however, was set aside in 2005 and the matter was sent back to the MPS for re-determination. In August of 2009, the applicant was informed that his application was in the redrafting stage and no timeline could be provided. As in this case, the MPS relied on an affidavit submitted by Ms. Barrette. She indicated a draft recommendation had been prepared and would be disclosed to the applicant for comment within six to eight weeks. As in this case, the MPS argued that the delay was not unreasonable for a number of reasons: a) since the decision had to be made by the Minister, who had a wide range of other responsibilities, b) many levels of assessment and review were involved, and c)",A mandamus order should issue against the MPS when there is an unreasonable delay in re-determining an application for ministerial relief.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [19] For the reasons given below, the standard by which the RAD reviewed the RPD's decision is not dispositive of this application for judicial review, and so there is no need to pronounce on the standard of review for that issue (see TARGETCASE; also see REFERENCE).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [25] In short, the facts of this case align with the jurisprudence of this Court where incompetence was found due to a failure of the representative to submit evidence that clearly should have been submitted and for which logic defies failure to submit that evidence.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [9] Where, as here, a decision-maker is considering a fact-specific, discretionary matter with little legal content, the range of possible, acceptable outcomes available to the decision-maker may be quite broad.

Opp. B.), at 145; <REFERENCE> (T.M. Opp. B.), at 409. While the burden of proof, after all the evidence has been weighed, rests with the respondent (the applicant before the Registrar), an absence of evidence with respect to any given fact does not have to be treated as favouring the appellant (objector before the Registrar). With respect to the factual situation under consideration, if catering services are not ordinarily engaged in by wholesale and retail meat suppliers as an ancillary business, there will be no evidence. To expect the respondent to prove such absence is not reasonable. I do not think the Registrar erred in saying that in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, he was entitled to assume that catering services were not normally an ancillary business for wholesale and retail meat suppliers. He recognized that ""at the end of the day"", so to speak, the burden of proving her case rested with the applicant before him.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [18] In my view, the following considerations support the view that a reasonableness standard of review should be applied in reviewing the RPD's interpretation and application of paragraph 97(1)(b)(ii) of the IRPA to the specific factual situations with which it may be presented: a. The existence of subsection 162(1) of the IRPA and the fact that decisions of the RPD are reviewable only if this Court grants leave to commence judicial review suggest that some level of deference should be extended to the RPD in this regard ( <REFERENCE> , above, at paras. 55 and 56; Canada (Minister of Citizenship and <TARGETCASE> at para. 24). b.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [20] <TARGETCASE> (T.D.), Lemieux, J., relied on the decision in Lambie , supra, in support of his conclusion that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to make an award of legal costs to a complainant. More specifically, he stated the following at page 210: ""The Tribunal ordered the payment of legal costs of $4,057.22. There was evidence in the record that Nancy Green had retained professional services in October 1995 until the end of June 1996 to help in the preparation of her submissions to the Commission for its deliberation in its decision-making process. ""The Attorney General argues the Act is silent as to the awarding of legal costs and the only possible reference to any power which may be analogous to that of granting legal costs is the reference to expenses in paragraph 53(2)(c). The Attorney General cites <REFERENCE> (F.C.T.D.), where my colleague Nadon, J., said at page 315 that the Act does not confer jurisdiction to award costs although Parliament could easily have included such a power.",The Tribunal has no jurisdiction to make an award of legal costs to a complainant.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: It surely does appear to result (when the statement of claim is struck out) in a ""judgment or other decision that determines in whole or in part any substantive right of the parties in controversy in any judicial proceeding"", and that is the definition of a ""final judgment"" as expressed in s. 2 of the Federal Court Act . Although the prothonotary is accorded the right to adjudicate such an issue, the prothonotary is in effect interfering with any party's substantive right in controversy, for the grounds for striking out a statement of claim do not purport to operate so as to extinguish any party's substantive rights. Where substantive rights are in controversy, no statement of claim may be struck out - that which must be plain and obvious when rule 419(1)(a) is invoked. When the prothonotary is empowered to strike out a statement of claim, he does so effectively on a motion to remove a nullity, an excrescence in which substantive rights are simply not articulated. That is why the prothonotary's judgment is not ""final"" in contemplation of the statutory definition, even although it could otherwise be regarded as terminal with regard to the excrescence. That has been held to be determining an interlocutory application. < TARGETCASE>","When substantive rights are in controversy, no statement of claim may be struck out and a prothonotary's judgment in such a case is not considered 'final' in the context of the statutory definition."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [59] The first problem that I have with the Applicant's submissions on this issue is that he now provides submissions to the Court that were not made to the Officer. If the Applicant had made those comments in the context of a request for a substituted evaluation, the Officer may have been obliged to provide further analysis and reasons. That was not done. <REFERENCE> Justice Mosley stated: Visa Officers have the authority to consider an alternative evaluation under subsection 76(3) by their own motion, as held by my colleague Justice Carolyn Layden-Stevenson in <TARGETCASE> Imm. L.R. (3d) 72. That said, it is clear from the jurisprudence that they are under no obligation to exercise that discretion unless specifically requested to do so. The applicant concedes that she did not make such a request and I cannot therefore find that the Visa Officer was unreasonable in her decision.

The Respondent submits that both these cases differ significantly from the present case. In both cases, there was prima facie evidence that the person concerned would face the death penalty or a risk of torture upon extradition or deportation, respectively. In both cases, the person concerned was under the control of Canadian officials at the time that the remedy was sought.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [21] The Registrar noted the applicant's argument that in order for use of a trade-mark to have occurred as of a certain date, among other things there must have been a transfer of actual possession of the wares, which the applicant submitted followed from the decision in <TARGETCASE> (QL) (TD) [ Manhattan Industries ]. Accordingly, the applicant argued that because the respondent did not take actual possession of the wares in Canada during the Relevant Period, use of the wares did not occur in accordance with section 4 of the Act . The Registrar nonetheless agreed with the respondent, relying on the decision of <REFERENCE> CPR (4th) 49 [ <REFERENCE> ], that the use of a trade-mark pursuant to section 4 of the Act occurred when an order for a substantial amount of trade-marked goods was placed and accepted prior to the expiry of the Relevant Period, when delivery of the goods and fulfillment of the purchase occurred soon thereafter.

That document was not discussed in the Board's decision, and no valid reasons were given to reject this evidence. The Federal Court clearly stated in the case of <TARGETCASE> ; 74 F.T.R. 161 (T.D.), at paragraphs 10 and 13, that a decision of the Board should not stand when it makes no references to relevant evidence: <REFERENCE> ""But assuming the board's conclusion in relation to changes in the circumstances in Bulgaria is a significant factor in its ultimate decision, as I believe it to be, then the board clearly ought to have considered the letter from the applicant's parents, giving it such weight as the board might determine in assessing whether the change in circumstances since the applicant left Bulgaria affected his claim to fear persecution were he to return.",A decision of the Board should not stand when it makes no references to relevant evidence.

First, it is necessary to determine whether refugee claimants physically present in Canada are entitled to the protection of s. 7 of the Charter . Second, the court must consider whether the impugned legislative provisions, in this case the requirement to certify a question to enable appeal to the Court of Appeal, deny a refugee claimant's rights under s. 7. Third, it must be decided whether the limitations imposed on the applicant's rights are justified within the meaning of s. 1 of the Charter .

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [42] When considering a TRV, it is important to balance the requirement of fairness with the requirements of the administrative immigration process. The Respondent contends that this process contains ""a significantly lower fairness threshold,"" which includes ""a minimal requirement (if any) for reasons."" As the Court stated in Li, above, at paragraph 50: <REFERENCE> In balancing the factors in Baker, the procedural requirements mandated by the duty of fairness should be relaxed for the processing of applications for student authorizations by visa officers overseas.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [27] Justice Layden-Stevenson elaborated on the distinction at paragraphs 37 and 38: <REFERENCE> [...] It necessarily follows that the references to ""a decision"" and ""the decision"" in subsection 30(1) refer to the Minister's determination under section 27 of the Act. In my view, it cannot reasonably be construed in any other way. Consequently, the Federal Court's jurisdiction, pursuant to section 30 of the Act, is limited to reviewing the decision under section 27 of the Act. That decision is with respect to whether or not there was a contravention of the Act under subsection 12(1). <TARGETCASE> While other ministerial decisions taken in the context of a seizure under the Act, such as a decision under section 29, may be the subject of judicial review applications initiated under section 18 of the Federal Courts Act , R.S.C., 1985, c.

Section 24 of the Act constitutes a strong privative clause that insulates, but does not immunize, decisions (other than those under section 27) from judicial review. Indeed the Minister takes the position that judicial review of such decisions is available and the existence and ambit of the privative clause is to be assessed in the consideration of the factors comprising the pragmatic and functional analysis (see: <REFERENCE> D.L.R.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [59] The applicants' second main argument is that the bonds should not be estreated because they were not at fault for Nabil's flight. They extract this principle by analogy to the criminal law. To begin, the propriety of the analogy is questionable. In TARGETCASE, I cited REFERENCE and expressed a wariness to draw parallels with the criminal law, due to the particular statutory provisions and purposes of the immigration regime. The applicants' argument that reliance on the criminal law is now appropriate, because changes were made to the policy manual in 2007, is not persuasive. The amended manual does not set out a process that is any closer to the criminal process. Moreover, the underlying statutory and regulatory provisions have not been amended. As such, I see no reason to abandon the position I took in REFERENCE . The culpability of the bondspersons should not be a primary consideration for a CBSA officer deciding whether to estreat a bond.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [28] One of the ultimate goals of most refugee claimants is to become a permanent resident - and eventually a citizen - of Canada. In general, a foreign national must obtain status in Canada before entering Canada ( IRPA , s. 11). An exception is made for ""protected persons,"" including persons who are found to be Convention refugees. Convention refugees do not automatically obtain status in Canada as permanent residents. However, as provided for in s. 21(2) of IRPA , such persons become permanent residents of Canada if an immigration officer is satisfied that: (a) they have applied for permanent residence status in accordance with the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations , SOR/2002-227 (the Regulations ); and (b) they are not inadmissible to Canada on any of the grounds set out in ss. 34, 35, 36(1), 37 or 38 of IRPA .

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [51] My concern in this case is that the Board did not explain why it gave greater weight to the attributed statement of the Sri Lankan High Commissioner, which is also not an independent source, than to the AI report. The AI report states that those on board the M.V. Sun Sea may be exposed to a serious risk of detention, torture and mistreatment on return should the Sri Lankan authorities in turn suspect they had been on board those vessels. While the Board reasonably found that the Applicant had no prior links to the LTTE, it is not the Applicant's past that would lead to such suspicion, but his travel on the M.V. Sun Sea. This is the very nature of the sur place claim, being that while a person was not a refugee when he left his country he may become one as a result of his own actions, such as association with others, after he has left his country of origin and this is what the AI report speaks to. Further, although the Board also states that there are reports that the Sri Lankan government will not automatically presume passengers have ties with the LTTE, these are not identified in the decision nor is the reference made to the Freedom from Torture briefing report dated September 13, 2012 entitled ""Sri Lankan Tamils tortured on return from the UK"". <TARGETCASE> ","A person may become a refugee as a result of his own actions, such as association with others, after he has left his country of origin."

An administrative tribunal need not meet the definition of a court of competent jurisdiction in s. 24(1) of the Charter in order to have the necessary authority to subject its enabling statute to Charter scrutiny. In the present case, the relevant inquiry is not whether the tribunal is a 'court' [within the meaning of subs. 24(1) of the Charter ] but whether the legislature intended to confer on the tribunal the power to interpret and apply the Charter . <REFERENCE> . . . . . <TARGETCASE> ""... The legislature expressly, and without reservation, conferred authority on the Board to decide points of law. In addition, the Act confers powers on the Board to determine questions of law and fact relating to its own jurisdiction.

The issue, then, is whether this authority with respect to questions of law can encompass the question of whether a law violates the Charter . It is clear to me that a Charter issue must constitute a question of law; indeed, the Charter is part of the supreme law of Canada.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [30] In <TARGETCASE> , above, Justice Rothstein was faced with this same issue. There, too, the constitution of a Band Appeal Tribunal was challenged on the basis of a failure to observe a timing requirement for the selection of members. In rejecting the same argument that has been made here, Justice Rothstein held: ""27 In my view, an important reason for electing the Appeal Tribunal before the nomination meeting is that it will be in place throughout the election process to deal with the matters over which it has jurisdiction. Another reason for it being constituted before the nomination meeting may be that its members will, at an early stage, avoid becoming involved in a partisan way in the election. Neither reason, however, suggests that the timing of the election of the Appeal Tribunal is of such overriding importance that non-compliance with the timing requirement of paragraph 6(4)(a) should result in the actions of an appeal tribunal elected after a nomination meeting being of no legal effect.",Non-compliance with the timing requirement for the selection of members of a Band Appeal Tribunal does not result in the actions of the tribunal being of no legal effect.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [8] The Officer was also not convinced that the Applicants were so established in Canada that severing their links here would cause unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship. Although they had been satisfactorily managing their finances, they had been on social assistance when they first came and Mr. Kozomara had only been employed since April, 2011. Mrs. Kozomara was never employed at all. The Applicants had submitted many letters of support from their community, but the Officer noted that H&C relief is not meant to be granted just because someone would make a good citizen or would likely be better off in Canada (citing, e.g. TARGETCASE). In the Officer's view, the Applicants had not established any hardship other than that which is inherent to removal from a place where they have lived, and that type of hardship was anticipated by the IRPA and within the Applicants' control to avoid.

In undertaking a pragmatic and functional analysis I must clearly identify the particular question at issue in the Decision under review; 3.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [24] It is not sufficient to say that pharmacists or physicians would prescribe PPC-Moxifloxacin in an infringing manner and therefore inducement is made out. It is the second person's actions which are at issue, and not the infringing conduct of others, as was found by Madam Justice Mactavish in REFERENCE: 367 Based upon all of the above considerations, the applicants argue that because of the nature of the Canadian market for memantine, infringement of the '492 patent will inevitably occur as physicians will prescribe, pharmacists will dispense, and patients will use ratiopharm's memantine product in combination therapy. 368 This may well be the case. Indeed, the circumstantial evidence suggests that ratiopharm's ratio-MEMANTINE product may indeed end up being used in combination with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, thereby infringing the '492 patent. ratiopharm may expect this to happen. However, it is ratiopharm's actions and not its expectations that are the issue before me. 369 The parties agree that the fact that there may be downstream infringement is not enough, on its own, to show infringement by inducement. Indeed, as Justice Gauthier observed inREFERENCE TARGETCASE, even if it can be shown that infringement by others ""is highly probable, if not inevitable"", that will not be enough to establish that an allegation of non-infringement is not justified: see para. 31.

As Mr. Agnaou argues, if the PSST (and the Public Service Labour Relations Board [PSLRB]) are to be afforded deference in their interpretations of the CHRA and the EEA, there is a real possibility that conflicts will appear in the jurisprudence, with fundamental rights being interpreted in one fashion for public servants when they appear before the PSEA or the PSST and in another fashion by the CHRC and CHRT in other contexts. Moreover, the Federal Court of Appeal has recently held in <REFERENCE> that the CHRT's interpretation of the CHRA, in terms of defining what is meant by ""discrimination"", is subject to review on a correctness standard. Thus, there is considerable weight to the argument that the PSST's interpretation of what conduct amounts to discrimination under the CHRA is to be reviewed on a correctness standard. ",The PSST's interpretation of what conduct amounts to discrimination under the CHRA is to be reviewed on a correctness standard.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [24] In fact, the panel applied the standard of proof correctly in finding that the Minister had established that there were ""serious reasons for considering"" that the claimant had engaged in the acts alleged against him. Obviously, that standard is considerably lower than the standard that applies in criminal law (""beyond a reasonable doubt"") or even in civil law (""on a balance of probabilities""). The reason for this is simply that the panel is required to determine not whether the person concerned is criminally responsible, but only whether they may claim refugee protection in Canada ( <REFERENCE> , above, at pages 311-312; <TARGETCASE> ACWS (3d) 915).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [10] The question of the existence of an IFA is determinative of the matter. As set out in <REFERENCE> , above, at paragraph 21, the concept of an IFA is an inherent part of the Convention refugee definition.

As noted, in REFERENCE the Court of Appeal held that it is only necessary that an adequate translation be provided and hence trivial imperfections in translation do not violate section 14 of the Charter . This Court has often applied this principle and held that trifling inconsistencies do not amount to a failure of adequate translation.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [68] In the Queen of Leman , above, the U.S. Court of Appeals did not specifically refer to the decision in Rainbow , above.

[see footnote 10] The Court said the following in respect of this decision: ""Interforce relies primarily, but unpersuasively, on <TARGETCASE> (5th Cir. 1981). It characterizes Gulf Trading as holding that because a maritime lien arises by operation of law, not by contract, the P & I choice of law provisions do not bind those who are not parties to the contract. Gulf Trading , however, does not control the outcome here. In that case, the court applied a conflict of laws analysis to the issue of a maritime lien. Id. at 367-68.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [11] The respondent is correct: the applicants have failed to prove how their legal counsel's behavior at the time of the hearing prejudiced them. While the circumstances of this case are very different than the cases relied on by the applicants, these cases do establish that the incompetence of counsel at the hearing can result in a denial of a fair hearing and provides grounds for judicial review on the basis of a breach of natural justice ( <REFERENCE> , above at para 11). Thus, where by no fault of the applicant, counsel's misconduct results in the applicant being denied the opportunity to a hearing, a reviewable breach occurs ( <REFERENCE> , above at para 11; <TARGETCASE> , above). However, the applicants were not denied a hearing: their refugee claim proceeded. Thus, in such a case, the Board's decision can only be reviewed where extraordinary circumstances are proven, such that ""there is sufficient evidence to establish the 'exact dimensions of the problem'"" ( <REFERENCE> , above at para 12). Thereby, where the incompetence or negligence of counsel is sufficiently specific and supported by the evidence, such behavior is inherently prejudicial to the applicants, resulting in a denial of a fair hearing ( <REFERENCE> , above at para 12). However, the applicants have not adduced any such evidence. ","Where by no fault of the applicant, counsel's misconduct results in the applicant being denied the opportunity to a hearing, a reviewable breach occurs."

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [114] The Respondent takes the position that the Arbitrator acted reasonably in finding that three of the alleged irregularities and breaches of the Election Regulations had been established but did not materially affect the result of the election.

The Board had an obligation to assess the evidence that contradicted its findings and explain why that evidence did not alter its conclusion: REFERENCE; TARGETCASE. This is also true, the Applicant argues, where the contradictory evidence is general country condition evidence: REFERENCE , REFERENCE. The common presumption that the Board has considered all of the evidence cannot systematically immunize the decision from judicial review: REFERENCE.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [23] In <TARGETCASE> , supra, at para. 2, Mr. Justice Décary stated that the decision in <REFERENCE> stands for the proposition that ""the best interests of the child are not determinative of the issue of removal to be decided by the Minister."" An immigration officer does not commit an error simply because he or she finds that the children's interests are outweighed by other factors. Rather, the court must ensure that the officer was ""alert, alive and sensitive"" to the interests of the children and acted reasonably in finding those interests were outweighed by other considerations.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [25] In Harb, supra, at paragraph 18, the Federal Court of Appeal quoted with approval the following passage from <TARGETCASE> (QL), at paragraph 11, where it is clearly recognized that personal and knowing participation does not require formal membership in the group and may be from within or outside an organization: In our view, it goes without saying that ""personal and knowing participation"" can be direct or indirect and does not require formal membership in the organization that is ultimately engaged in the condemned activities. It is not working within an organization that makes someone an accomplice to the organization's activities, but knowingly contributing to those activities in any way or making them possible, whether from within or from outside the organization. At p. 318, MacGuigan J.A. said that ""[a] t bottom, complicity rests . . . on the existence of a shared common purpose and the knowledge that all of the parties in question may have of it"". Those who become involved in an operation that is not theirs, but that they know will probably lead to the Board of an international offence, lay themselves open to the application of the exclusion clause in the same way as those who play a direct part in the operation.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [21] Recently, the Supreme Court of Canada in <REFERENCE> [ Smith ] held that, where a tribunal is interpreting its enabling statute, that tribunal's interpretation will be subject to the reasonableness standard. (see paragraphs 26-34 and 37). This approach was followed by Justice Paul Crampton in <REFERENCE> where he held at paragraph 24 that the standard of review on the applicability of subsection 108(4) is reasonableness. Further, Justice Crampton thoroughly addressed this question in <REFERENCE> included that the standard of review on this issue is reasonableness.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [55] According to <TARGETCASE> ; 137 D.L.R.(3d) 687 (F.T.D.), this court has jurisdiction under s. 18 to issue an injunction restraining a Minister or a federal board from executing their statutory duties in a manner that is illegal or ultra vires. Section 50 of the Federal Court Act allows this court, in its discretion, to stay proceedings in any cause or matter where for any other reason it is in the interest of justice that the proceedings be stayed. Any stay ordered under this section may subsequently be lifted in the discretion of this court. Section 18.2 allows this court, on an application for judicial review, to make such interim orders as it considers appropriate pending the final disposition of the application. According to the above sections, I believe that this court has jurisdiction to issue an Order restraining the Minister from deporting the applicants pending the outcome of s. 114(2) applications for landing on humanitarian or compassionate grounds. The facts peculiar to this case, and the implication in <REFERENCE> that a risk assessment should be done before deporting failed refugee claimants in order to determine whether deportation may violate their Charter rights, cry out for such an outcome. Conclusion ","This court has jurisdiction to issue an injunction restraining a Minister or a federal board from executing their statutory duties in a manner that is illegal or ultra vires, and to issue an Order restraining the Minister from deporting applicants pending the outcome of applications for landing on humanitarian or compassionate grounds."

No evidence has been adduced to show the inconvenience and expense of proceeding in Canada rather than Japan.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [23] Keeping in mind that purpose, the respondent argues that subsection 25(1.3) was enacted in order to clearly separate these applications from refugee protection proceedings and avoid duplication within the system. Therefore, the role of an officer is to consider the credible facts presented through a lens of hardship and the officer cannot reassess whether applicants should have received refugee protection. In the respondent's view, subsection 25(1.3) codifies that officers are meant to be looking at elements of hardship, rather than factors relating to risk (citing <TARGETCASE> FTR 17 [ <REFERENCE> ]).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [131] Once again, Mylan tried to rely on the REFERENCE case, not so much for its factual finding but for the purpose of impugning Dr. Bugay's credibility. In that case, Dr. Bugay was responsible for particle size testing after extraction. Because the extraction process used in that case was validated in exactly the ways Dr. Bugay said were irrelevant (i.e. by reporting yield and by running the API through the extraction procedure), Mylan would like this Court to infer that Dr. Bugay's explanation for not doing the validation is not credible. I agree with Lilly that such an inference would be unwarranted and that the statements from another witness in REFERENCE cannot form the basis to impeach the credibility of Dr. Bugay in this case. One cannot impeach a witness on a prior inconsistent statement unless it is that same witness's own prior statement; the fact that Dr. Bugay may have been in Court when the expert who did the extraction testified, is not sufficient. Moreover, the TARGETCASE case deals with a different patent, different facts and different evidence. As a result, this case is not relevant for the purpose of the determinations to be made here, and cannot be used to question Dr. Bugay's testimony as an expert in the case at bar. ","The statements from another witness in a different case cannot be used to impeach the credibility of a witness in the current case, even if the facts and evidence of the two cases are different."

However, in <REFERENCE> (F.C.A.), at pages 588-89 <TARGETCASE> , the Federal Court of Appeal appears to have concluded that deportation of a permanent resident as a result of criminal convictions does engage s. 7 of the Charter as it actually examined whether fundamental justice had been accorded to that person. Moreover, in <REFERENCE> (F.C.A.), at pages 704-05 <REFERENCE> , the Federal Court of Appeal held that the deprivation of liberty involved in any forced deportation is given a new dimension when the individual to be deported claims to be a refugee, therefore, it is appropriate to assume that s. 7 of the Charter is brought into play with respect to the scheme as a whole.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [40] Thus, contrary to the applicant's submissions, REFERENCE above, does not indicate that the failure to conduct the analysis is a reviewable error; rather, it is the incorrect application of that test, if it is applied, that is a reviewable error. It is also notable that in REFERENCE, Mr. Justice Michael Phelan observed that in TARGETCASE above, the Federal Court of Appeal did not deal with Article 1F(b). This seems to suggest that an equivalency analysis is not required in an Article 1F(b) determination (as will be discussed further below). ",An equivalency analysis is not required in an Article 1F(b) determination.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [13] Although the particular circumstances of each case and the clauses interpreted differ somewhat the fact remains that in both cases the work of the person employed was done by telephone from home, the employer did not ask the person employed to physically return to the usual workplace, the person employed was able to perform the duties at home and those duties were part of the regular work. Additionally, referring to the French version of the clauses in question the language which has to be interpreted is identical: in Redden clause M-30.04 of the collective agreement uses the words ""rentrer au travail"" (report for work) and clause M-29.01 the words ""rentre au travail"" (returns to work). Although the adjudicative decisions are not unanimous regarding call-back there was at the time of the decision a quo a line of authority holding that the employee did not need to make the journey and be at his usual workplace to be regarded as ""recalled to work"" (see Canadian Pacific Limited (Telecommunications Department) and Canadian Telecommunications Union, Division No. 1 of the United Telegraph Workers , not reported, cited in <TARGETCASE> (Man.), at p. 244).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [27] As mentioned, parties to the Convention chose a fairly low evidentiary threshold to determine if a refugee claimant has committed a serious non-political crime before seeking protection in the country of refuge. Parliament has also given the RPD a lot of freedom to receive any evidence it considers credible and trustworthy (subsections 170(g) and (h) of the Act ). That said, the need for ""serious grounds"" is protection against arbitrary and capricious action especially in light of the dire consequences resulting from an exclusion pursuant to Article 1F(b) of the Convention . For this standard to be meaningful, it requires a proper and objective assessment of the context as well as all the evidence presented by the refugee claimant. Obviously, the RPD must be particularly cautious when charges led have been dismissed by a competent court in accordance with the rule of law. <TARGETCASE> ","For the 'serious grounds' standard to be meaningful, it requires a proper and objective assessment of the context and all the evidence presented by the refugee claimant, with particular caution when charges have been dismissed by a competent court in accordance with the rule of law."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [43] The Applicant submits that the Member erred by failing to apply the correct criteria for membership.

Not every act of support for an organization constitutes membership ( <REFERENCE> ), and activities which are minimal or marginal are not enough to constitute membership under paragraph 34(1)( f ) ( <TARGETCASE> at paragraph 37; <REFERENCE> at paragraph 28).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [31] Issue 2 <REFERENCE> Did the officer err in her reasons to deny the request for deferral of removal? <REFERENCE> The officer's decision came in the form of notes to file. These notes constitute her reasons for decision (see <REFERENCE> : <TARGETCASE> Enforcement officers have a limited discretion to defer the removal of persons who have been ordered to leave Canada. Generally speaking, officers have an obligation to remove persons as soon as reasonably practicable (s. 48(2), Immigration and Refugee Protection Act , S.C. 2001, c. 27; set out in the attached Annex). However, consistent with that duty, officers can consider whether there are good reasons to delay removal . Valid reasons may be related to the person's ability to travel (e.g. illness or a lack of proper travel documents), the need to accommodate other commitments (e.g. school or family obligations), or compelling personal circumstances (e.g. humanitarian and compassionate considerations). ( <REFERENCE> (F.C.) (QL)). It is clear, however, that the mere fact that a person has an outstanding application for humanitarian and compassionate relief is not a sufficient ground to defer removal. On the other hand, an officer must consider whether exigent personal circumstances, particularly those involving children, justify delay.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [51] However, the plaintiffs correctly note that another line of reasoning running through these cases is that the Trade-marks Act should not be allowed to support unlawful use. In <TARGETCASE> , supra, Joyal, J., explained this argument in the following manner (at pages 298-99 <REFERENCE> ): ""I interpret the whole scheme of the Trade-marks Act as continuing the policy and purpose of its predecessor statute, the Unfair Competition Act [R.S.C. 1952, c. 274], to bring some semblance of order in the market place and to codify or structure in statute form the rights, duties and privileges of intellectual property owners at common law. Its whole thrust is to promote and regulate the lawful use of the trademarks. On proper grounds, a person may be given a statutory (i.e. lawful) monopoly for the exclusive use of a trademark in association with specified wares or services. In the event, can it be seriously argued that by specific intendment, or by implication, the statute would not also prohibit unlawful use?","The Trade-marks Act promotes and regulates the lawful use of trademarks, and by implication, prohibits unlawful use."

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [48] However, Mr. Justice Beetz chose to interpret the Immigration Act having regard to the Bill of Rights . With respect to the first criterion to be met, in relation to the definition of ""rights and obligations"", he stated, at p. 228 <REFERENCE> : <REFERENCE> ""Be that as it may, it seems clear to me that the ambit of s. 2(e) is broader than the list of rights enumerated in s. 1 which are designated as 'human rights and fundamental freedoms' whereas in s. 2(e), what is protected by the right to a fair hearing is the determination of one's 'rights and obligations', whatever they are and whenever the determination process is one which comes under the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada. It is true that the first part of s. 2 refers to 'the rights or freedoms herein recognized and declared', but s. 2(e) does protect a right which is fundamental, namely 'the right to a fair hearing in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice' for the determination of one's rights and obligations, fundamental or not. It is my view that ... the right guaranteed by s. 2(e) is in no way qualified by the 'due process' concept mentioned in s. 1(a). <TARGETCASE> ","The right to a fair hearing for the determination of one's rights and obligations, as protected by s. 2(e), is broader than the list of rights enumerated in s. 1 and is not qualified by the 'due process' concept mentioned in s. 1(a)."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [19] The second point makes the case of <TARGETCASE> readily distinguishable from the situation here since the whole burden of the argument put forward by Mr. Lester is that the Department of Justice, notwithstanding its awareness of the implied undertaking, proposes to breach it and to turn the documents in question over to the archives. There is thus a real threat that the confidentiality of the information obtained on discovery will be lost. It is also by no means clear that the defendant here has any property rights in the documents: the copies were made by the plaintiff and certainly belonged at one time to it. Mr. Lester argues that I should infer from the fact that the settlement payment included a sum for costs that property in the documents thereupon passed to the Crown. I can draw no such inference; on the contrary, it seems to me to be far more likely that it was an implied term of the settlement agreement that the documents would be destroyed or returned in accordance with the wishes of the party who had produced them in the first place, a course which was originally proposed by the Crown's lawyers themselves.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [131] Mr. Agnaou argues that his evidence established that his situation was analogous to that in <TARGETCASE> (1971) [ Duke Power ], discussed in O'Malley , where the U.S. Supreme Court held that a hiring criterion of possessing a high school diploma adversely impacted black people because, at the relevant time and in the relevant recruitment area, fewer black than white people had completed high school. Mr. Agnaou says that the same determination of adverse impact should have been made with respect to the human resources management experience criterion because much greater percentages of visible minorities were shown to have been present in the DOJ at the LA-00, 01 and 02A levels, where human resources management is not required, than at the LA-2B and 3A levels, where most positions do require management of subordinate employees.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [14] The Federal Court of Appeal nuanced this somewhat, holding that a mere refusal by the police or authorities to aid a claimant will not suffice to displace this presumption; the burden of proof on the individual increases in proportion to the democratic nature of a particular state's institutions ( <REFERENCE> (F.C.A.)).

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [27] Section 25 does not offer an exhaustive list of illnesses or ailments that qualify for the label disability.

Human Rights Trib.), the Tribunal focused on ""any physical characteristic utilized to reject an individual"" as an element of disability. Thus, the fact that the Tribunal characterized Mr. Mills' disability as a ""back ailment"" is no bar to his entitlement to seek relief on the ground of disability. Disability, after all, is a question of degree and must be measured in a variety of contexts and situations.

An applicant may attempt to rebut the presumption that a crime is serious by addressing the factors listed by the Federal Court of Appeal in TARGETCASE above. However, this jurisprudence does not require the Board to re-examine the evidence that was presented to the court of competent jurisdiction to determine whether the conviction was properly rendered.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [23] In the case at bar, I am of the view that the applicant's submission on this issue is premature. There is substantial jurisprudence of this court to the effect that the jurisdiction of the adjudicator is restricted to making a deportation order.

Absent a decision to actually remove the applicant to a particular country and in view of the jurisprudence of this court, I cannot conclude that the making of the deportation order was in any way a violation of the applicant's Charter rights. The applicant's submission on this point must fail.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [11] The Applicant also submitted that the fact that the visa officer, and not the IPO, made the decision to refuse his application for student authorization violates the principle that ""he who hears must decide."" This violation resulted in a breach of procedural fairness because the visa officer's specific concerns about the Applicant's credibility were not brought to the attention of the Applicant. As a result, the Applicant did not have an opportunity to disabuse the visa officer of those concerns. Therefore, the failure of the person who heard the case to decide the case resulted in a breach of procedural fairness requiring this application for judicial review to be allowed ( Patel , supra; <TARGETCASE> (T.D.)). <REFERENCE> ",The failure of the person who heard the case to decide the case results in a breach of procedural fairness.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [15] As per the Supreme Court in <REFERENCE> ; 2 N.R. 397, at p. 254, adopted in <TARGETCASE> , above, at para. 25, the three preconditions for the operation of issue estoppel are that: (1) the same question has been decided in earlier proceedings; (2) the judicial decision which is said to create the estoppel was final; and (3) the parties to the judicial decision were the same persons as the parties to the proceedings in which the estoppel is raised.

"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [186] First, the evidence establishes that, at all times, it was the applicant who was demanding that the procedural safeguards be observed, while the decision-maker should have taken it upon herself to offer these safeguards to the applicant and explain the decisional framework to him. It was not until after the applicant sent a letter to the Prime Minister that he was offered, in the letter dated February 24, 2004, the opportunity to assert in writing his right to respond to the reasons for dissatisfaction. Moreover, the Minister of Industry did not offer to meet with the applicant, instead the applicant had to request that a meeting be held. One wonders whether the applicant would have had the chance to meet with the Minister of Industry if he had not requested it. It seems to me that if the Governor in Council is the master of her procedure, it is her responsibility to put it into operation and not the applicant's responsibility to beg for it. This is at least the approach that was observed in Wedge and <TARGETCASE> , above. That alone is not necessarily fatal, but could be an element that is inconsistent with fair play and transparency. ","The decision-maker has the responsibility to offer procedural safeguards to the applicant and explain the decisional framework, not the applicant's responsibility to request for it."

Documentation Information and Research Branch. The relevant portions follows: <REFERENCE> ""... There is a temporary and a full 'carte de resident' for foreign nationals in France. The temporary card is valid for one year; the full card for 10 years, the carte de resident may be renewed by the Prefecture, who is part of the Ministry of the Interior. <REFERENCE> ""... The only obligation is to avoid breaking the law, as resident status could be jeopardized by an illegality. ... <REFERENCE> ""A full card holder who wishes to leave France needs an 'exit/reentry visa'. These visas permit travel outside France for a period of 3 months, 6 months, or 1 year, and can be renewed. If the holder is out of France for more than 3 consecutive years, then the holder must reapply for a carte de resident. <REFERENCE> . . . . . <TARGETCASE> ""During a telephone interview with the DIRB, an official of the Embassy of France in Ottawa stated that French consulates or embassies abroad do not have the mandate to renew exit/re-entry visas (Visa d'aller et retour) (3 Feb. 1995). The official stated that exit/re-entry visas are issued by the local préfectures on behalf of the Ministry of Interior. <REFERENCE> ","French consulates or embassies abroad do not have the mandate to renew exit/re-entry visas, these are issued by the local préfectures on behalf of the Ministry of Interior."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [30] The CBSA memorandum in the present case contains a recommendation in almost identical terms to that in <REFERENCE> and states that the information being forwarded to the officer ""provides sufficient conclusive evidence to support a determination of inadmissibility pursuant to paragraph 34 (1) (f) IRPA"". As in <REFERENCE> and <TARGETCASE> , disclosure was required to level the playing field. See also: <REFERENCE> a case decided by Justice Sean Harrington in which the failure to disclose a similar report in analogous circumstances was found to have denied the applicant procedural fairness. ",Disclosure is required to level the playing field in cases where information is forwarded to an officer as conclusive evidence to support a determination of inadmissibility.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [26] The Applicant submits that the IAD erred in concluding that the mere fact of working for a company that is controlled by the LTTE is a sufficient basis upon which to conclude that the person in question is or was a member of the LTTE. The Applicant also asserts that the IAD erred by failing to reasonably consider and balance factors that it was required to assess. I agree that the IAD appears to have committed both of these errors. In any event, it is clear that it committed the latter one. <TARGETCASE> ","The mere fact of working for a company controlled by the LTTE is not a sufficient basis to conclude that the person is or was a member of the LTTE, and the IAD is required to reasonably consider and balance factors in its assessment."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [10] Whether the Court applies the standard of reasonableness or correctness to the RAD's identification of its own standard of review is not always determinative of the outcome of an application for judicial review before this Court ( <REFERENCE> at para 37). As Justice Simon Noël remarked in <TARGETCASE> : [...] the standard of review this Court should apply when reviewing the standard of intervention chosen by the RAD in its review of a RPD decision is undecided. As noted, this question is not determinative with regards to the case at bar. I therefore adhere to Justice Martineau's approach in <REFERENCE> , supra at para 37, that until this question is resolved by the Federal Court of Appeal, a pragmatic approach should be used for the determination of the present judicial review. ",The standard of review this Court should apply when reviewing the standard of intervention chosen by the RAD in its review of a RPD decision is undecided.
question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [30] It should be noted that the rationale of the judicial review regime does not apply to the RAD's analysis ( <TARGETCASE> at paras 33-34; <REFERENCE> at para 34; <REFERENCE> [ Alyafi ]). <REFERENCE> ,The rationale of the judicial review regime does not apply to the RAD's analysis.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [22] The decision by the CHRC to accept a complaint is clearly a preliminary one, which, barring exceptional circumstances such as those outlined in paragraphs (a) to (e) of s. 41, the Commission is bound to undertake, in accord with s. 41 and in light of its statutory purpose. It is, in my view, an administrative decision, falling squarely within the competence and discretion of the CHRC, one with which the courts should be reluctant to interfere. [ <TARGETCASE> (T.D.)] As such a determination precedes the appointment of an investigator, there is not, as the submissions of the applicant appear to suggest, an evidentiary requirement, nor a threshold as to whether ""further inquiry is warranted"" such as that provided in s. 49 of the Act . The Commission is not bound to accept the recommendation of the human rights officer, but rather, as stated in the February 29, 1996 letter from the CHRC to DND, in considering the matter, the CHRC may ""decide to accept, change, or reject"" the officer's recommendation. Unless it has decided not to deal with a complaint, the Commission is not required to give reasons for its decision. (See s. 42(2) of the Act .) ","The decision by the CHRC to accept a complaint is an administrative decision within its competence and discretion, with which courts should be reluctant to interfere, and there is no evidentiary requirement or threshold for such a decision."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [49] The RPD's credibility finding was also unreasonable because it was based on a selective and microscopic analysis of the evidence. The Applicant relies on the Federal Court of Appeal's judgment on <REFERENCE> where it held the RPD should ""not be over-vigilant in its microscopic examination of the evidence."" She also points to <TARGETCASE> (FCA), where the Federal Court of Appeal held that ""selective treatment in respect of various segments of the appellant's testimony is not calculated to enhance one's confidence in the Board's assessment of the appellant's credibility."" The Respondent No Breach of Procedural Fairness ",Selective treatment in respect of various segments of the appellant's testimony is not calculated to enhance one's confidence in the Board's assessment of the appellant's credibility.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [12] <REFERENCE> Justice Donald J. Rennie of this Court examined carefully the so-called three lines of reasoning (some would contend that there are only two, with the third one being a variation on one of the two) concerning the residency requirements of paragraph 5(1)( c ) of the Act. Like him, I am not convinced that the test devised in Koo is one that is justified by an appropriate reading of section 5 of the Act. I reckon that Justice Allan Lutfy, in <TARGETCASE> Citizenship judges adopting either one of the tests devised by different judges of this Court. It is on that basis that the Citizenship Judge, in this case, chose the Koo test. ",Citizenship judges can adopt either one of the tests devised by different judges of this Court for the residency requirements of paragraph 5(1)( c ) of the Act.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [20] The onus is on the Minister to establish an exclusionary claim (see, for example, <TARGETCASE> (C.A.) (QL) at para. 34). In this case, the Minister provided detailed evidence of the charge, the convictions and decisions of all levels of court involved. There were no allegations by the Applicant that the documents were fraudulent. The existence of a conviction, and even a warrant, issued by a foreign country may be sufficient “serious reasons for considering” (see <REFERENCE> (T.D.) (Q.L.) at para. 18). The equivalent Canadian Criminal Code provision (s. 120(a)) provides for imprisonment for a maximum of 14 years thus meeting the standard for a “serious non-political crime” set out in <REFERENCE> . It follows that the Applicant's conviction is strong prima facie evidence to support the Article 1F(b) finding. This is particularly so, in this case, where the Board had before it evidence that the Applicant has had access to three levels of judicial oversight. ",The onus is on the Minister to establish an exclusionary claim.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [21] With respect to the second issue, this Court has consistently held that the analysis of state protection is to be evaluated on the standard of reasonableness. See <REFERENCE> , above at paragraph 28, <REFERENCE> , at paragraph 35, and <TARGETCASE> . ",The analysis of state protection is to be evaluated on the standard of reasonableness.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [12] After noting the issues raised by the applicant in the appeal, the RAD stated that it focused on four issues: <REFERENCE> Did the RPD err in its finding of fact that the applicant's allegations of fear of gangs were credible? <REFERENCE> Did the RPD err in its finding of fact that the applicant did not want to complete military service? <TARGETCASE> Did the RPD err in its finding of fact that the applicant was a supporter of the opposition and that he demonstrated a nexus to the Convention because of his imputed political opinion? <REFERENCE> Did the RPD err in its finding of fact that the applicant's delay in claiming undermined his subjective fear, which was fatal to his claim? <REFERENCE> ",Did the RPD err in its finding of fact that the applicant was a supporter of the opposition and that he demonstrated a nexus to the Convention because of his imputed political opinion?
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [53] Although my colleague Justice Roy dismissed any suggestion that an appeal before the RAD is [translation] ""an opportunity for a new trial or a reconsideration of the matter in its entirety"" ( <REFERENCE> , above at para 39), other colleagues of mine, Justices Shore, Phelan and Gagné are not as categorical and all three insist on the need for a re-examination of the evidence even in paper-based appeals ( <TARGETCASE> , above at paras 25 and 33; <REFERENCE> , above at paras 26 and 34; <REFERENCE> , above at paras 47, 48 and 52; <REFERENCE> , above at para 45). Without deciding in favour of either approach, it is precisely this kind of reflection and analysis of possible options that is sorely lacking in the decision under review, thus rendering it unreasonable. ",There is a need for a re-examination of the evidence even in paper-based appeals.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [9] Having duly considered the documentary evidence provided by the applicant, as well as both parties’ oral and written submissions, I am of the view that the visa officer’s decision to refuse Mr. Liu’s application for an immigrant visa was reasonable and certainly not patently unreasonable. Pursuant to section 11(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), the burden was on Mr. Liu to prove to the visa officer’s satisfaction that he fulfilled the legislative requirements ( <TARGETCASE> ",The burden is on the applicant to prove to the visa officer's satisfaction that they fulfill the legislative requirements.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [10] The test for a disqualifying apprehension of bias and the proper manner of its application are set out in the dissenting reasons of Justice Louis-Philippe de Grandpré in Committee for Justice and <REFERENCE> at para. 31. The test is whether an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically and having thought it through, would think it more likely than not that the decision maker would unconsciously or consciously decide the issue unfairly. The grounds must be substantial. A real likelihood or probability of bias must be demonstrated. Mere suspicion is not enough. <TARGETCASE> ","An informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically and having thought it through, would think it more likely than not that the decision maker would unconsciously or consciously decide the issue unfairly. The grounds must be substantial. A real likelihood or probability of bias must be demonstrated. Mere suspicion is not enough."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [28] The same considerations apply to paragraph 34(1)(f) of the Immigration Refugee and Protection Act . As was the case in the Immigration Act , under subsection 34(2) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act , membership in a terrorist organization does not constitute inadmissibility if the individual in question satisfies the Minister that their presence in Canada would not be detrimental to the national interest. Subsection 34(2) provides: <REFERENCE> '34(2) The matters referred to in subsection (1) do not constitute inadmissibility in respect of a permanent resident or a foreign national who satisfies the Minister that their presence in Canada would not be detrimental to the national interest.' <TARGETCASE> <REFERENCE> '34(2) Ces faits n'emportent pas interdiction de territoire pour le résident permanent ou l'étranger qui convainc le ministre que sa présence au Canada ne serait nullement préjudiciable à l'intérêt national.' <REFERENCE> Thus, under subsection 34(2), the Minister has the discretion to exclude the individual from the operation of paragraph 34(1)(f). <REFERENCE> ""","Membership in a terrorist organization does not constitute inadmissibility if the individual satisfies the Minister that their presence in Canada would not be detrimental to the national interest, giving the Minister the discretion to exclude the individual from the operation of paragraph 34(1)(f)."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [415] The applicants recognize that Justice Evans' comments in <TARGETCASE> were made with respect to participatory rights in connection with delegated legislation, rather than executive action. They say, however, that the distinction he drew between the enactment of statutory and delegated legislation, ""applies equally to Orders in Council untethered to statute"": applicants' memorandum of fact and law at para. 55. ",The distinction between the enactment of statutory and delegated legislation applies equally to Orders in Council untethered to statute.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [27] In an even more recent decision of Mr. Justice Nadon in <REFERENCE> Imm. L.R.(2d) 213 (T.D.), it was held that: <REFERENCE> ""It is clear from the foregoing jurisprudence that the reasonableness of the medical opinion may be an issue for the visa officer where on the evidence the opinion is or may be unreasonable. <TARGETCASE> Nadon, J., concluded that there was no reason for the visa officer to question the reasonableness of the opinion on the record before him, and, therefore, the visa officer's decision was reasonable. The issue, therefore, was whether there was anything before the visa officer that would cause the visa officer to question the reasonableness of the medical opinion based on the record before him. <REFERENCE> ",The reasonableness of the medical opinion may be an issue for the visa officer where on the evidence the opinion is or may be unreasonable.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [6] In order to provide guidance to officers tasked with such decisions and to ensure some measure of consistency in decision-making, the Minister has published IP 5 Immigrant Applications in Canada made on Humanitarian or Compassionate Grounds [IP5 Manual]. Therein the criterion of ""unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship"" is found. It has been adopted by this Court as appropriate and thus has more than mere administrative authority, as was observed by Justice Shore in <REFERENCE> : Moreover, the criterion of ""unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship"" or ""difficultés inhabituelles et injustifiées ou excessive"" has now been adopted by this Court in its decisions on subsection 25(1), which means that these terms are more than mere guidelines ( <REFERENCE> A.C.W.S. (3d) 500, at paragraph 16; <REFERENCE> A.C.W.S. (3d) 1050, at paragraph 35; <TARGETCASE> , at paragraph 17). ","The criterion of ""unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship"" has been adopted by the Court in its decisions on subsection 25(1), giving these terms more than mere guideline status."
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [63] Once again, this is an argument about the weighing of evidence. The Decision is based upon the Applicant's failure to demonstrate that the discontinuance of the position was made in good faith for economic reasons. As discussed earlier, I can find nothing to suggest that relevant evidence was either overlooked or inappropriately weighed by the Adjudicator in coming to the conclusion that the Applicant had not demonstrated good faith. <REFERENCE> JUDGMENT <TARGETCASE> ",The Decision is based upon the Applicant's failure to demonstrate that the discontinuance of the position was made in good faith for economic reasons.
question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [11] This judicial review raises the issue whether the Minister erred in denying the applicant a security certificate. In recognition of the specialized and discretionary nature of this decision the standard of review is reasonableness: TARGETCASE. Errors of law are reviewable on a standard of correctness. ,The standard of review for a Minister's decision on a security certificate is reasonableness.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [32] I do not agree with the Respondent that the IAD did not have a duty to assess whether the Applicant's youth criminal record was properly released. It is for the IAD to determine the admissibility, reliability and weight to be given to evidence presented before it. Although the IAD is not bound by the same legal or technical rules of evidence as a Court of law, I do not think that this confers upon the IAD the authority to admit a youth criminal record where the second conviction falls outside the Period of Access. In my view, the release of such a report would not only constitute a breach of section 118 of the YCJA , it would also amount to a breach of the procedural fairness guarantees in hearings before the IAD. The IAD in <TARGETCASE> was of the view (see paragraphs 60-62) that a properly authorized release of material is required before that material can be introduced into evidence, and I agree with them. <REFERENCE> ",A properly authorized release of material is required before that material can be introduced into evidence.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [62] I have come to the conclusion that discretion ought to be exercised in favour of the applicant: <REFERENCE> (1) The scheme of the Citizenship Act favour diligence in the granting or denying of citizenship. <REFERENCE> (2) The facts of this case show a lack of diligence on the part of the respondent. <REFERENCE> (3) Indeed, the facts of this case show a measure of misbehaviour on the part of some state actors, without any satisfactory explanation on this record. <REFERENCE> (4) The Khalil exception does not find application in the instant case. <REFERENCE> (5) The conditions required in order for a mandamus application have all been met: <REFERENCE> (a) there is a public duty to act; <REFERENCE> (b) the public duty is owed to the applicant; <REFERENCE> (c) there is a clear right to the performance of the duty. <REFERENCE> (d) there is no adequate remedy available; <REFERENCE> (e) the order will be of practical value or effect; <REFERENCE> (f) there is no equitable bar to the exercise of discretion and the relief sought; <TARGETCASE> (g) the balance of convenience favours the applicant. <REFERENCE> Costs <REFERENCE> ",The balance of convenience favours the applicant.
"question: what is the proposition in TARGETCASE? context: [93] Mr. Justice Rothstein stated: ""8. In any event, I do not think applying clause 19(1)(f)(iii)(B) to a person who retired from a terrorist organization in 1992 or, indeed, at any time before February 1, 1993, constitutes a retrospective application of the provision. Having been a member of a terrorist group is a continuing status. Put another way, finding that an individual is ineligible to remain in Canada on the basis that he was formerly a member of a terrorist organization is the imposition of a present consequence based on past behaviour in order to protect public safety. That is not retrospective application of legislation ( <TARGETCASE> at 319-20)."" (My emphasis) ","Finding that an individual is ineligible to remain in Canada on the basis that he was formerly a member of a terrorist organization is the imposition of a present consequence based on past behaviour in order to protect public safety, and is not a retrospective application of legislation."
