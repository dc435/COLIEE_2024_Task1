# COLIEE_2024_Task1

This repository contains the implementation of Task 1 of the 2024 *Competition on Legal Information and Extraction/Entailment (COLIEE)* by Damian Curran and Mike Conway.  Details of the implementation can be found in our paper *Similarity Ranking of Case Law Using Propositions as Features (2024)*.

**Instructions:**
1. Test and training data can be obtained from the COLIEE 2024 organisers. It should be placed in the /data subfolder.
2. The packages in requirements.txt are required. It may also be necessary to download the spacy model via command: python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm. All other models from HuggingFace used throughout the code should automatically download when the code is run.
3. Run the functions consecutively in main.ipynb.
